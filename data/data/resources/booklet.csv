88,90,FOREWORD,booklet6,8
89,91,"In 1998, the World Health Organization (WHO) Regional Office for Africa (AFRO) together with technical partners adopted a strategy for developing and implementing comprehensive public health surveillance and response systems in African countries, initially called integrated disease surveillance (IDS). However, to highlight the linkage between surveillance and response, the strategy was later re-named Integrated Disease Surveillance and Response (IDSR). Malawi adopted the first edition of the IDSR technical guidelines in 2005. Since then, there has been an investment in human and material resources to strengthen capacities for public health surveillance systems in order to prevent, timely detect, and respond appropriately to public health threats. ",booklet6,757
90,92,"The coming into force, in 2007, of the International Health Regulations (IHR 2005), the emergence of new diseases, conditions and events and the formulation of strategies for disaster risk management (DRM) resulted in the need to revise the first edition of the IDSR technical guidelines. There was also the need to address the increasing burden of non-communicable diseases. Furthermore, there was the need to strengthen community-based surveillance for early detection, rapid confirmation and response to public health threats. Moreover, alignment with broader system strengthening objectives was required. Hence, in 2010, the second edition of the IDSR guidelines was developed, which Malawi subsequently adapted in 2014.",booklet6,724
91,93,"Diseases, both communicable and non-communicable, continue to be a major cause of morbidity and mortality in Malawi and in the Africa region as a whole despite the advanced global knowledge on how to detect and control them. Of late, non-communicable diseases are increasingly becoming a major public health problem in the country. The majority of non-communicable diseases are preventable but multiple factors which include environmental, social, and economic determinants hamper effective prevention and control of these diseases. Emerging and re-emerging diseases and conditions pose a threat to the country’s health security. ",booklet6,630
92,94,"Responding to health emergencies remains a major challenge, as shown by recent health emergencies in the country as well as the African region, the unprecedented Ebola Virus Disease of 2014, the ongoing Coronavirus Disease of 2019 Pandemic. Specifically, challenges in capacity to prevent, detect and respond to public health threats have been identified. As one way of addressing these problems, the Ministry of Health is strengthening the disease surveillance systems using the Third Edition of the guidelines for IDSR as revised by the WHO-AFRO in 2018 and adapted to our context in 2020.",booklet6,591
93,95,"It is worth noting that, many Public Health Events (PHEs) and emergencies and their associated risk factors could be prevented or their effects mitigated. However, the health systems in most countries remain inadequate. To avert and mitigate the effects of future health security risks and emergencies, Malawi intends to  implement these IDSR technical guidelines. These guidelines recommend thresholds for action for priority diseases, conditions, public health events and responding to alerts. Using these action thresholds can be lifesaving. Therefore, it is important that we scale up and fully implement this third edition of the IDSR technical guidelines in the country as they explicitly describe what needs to be established at each level of the health system in order to detect, confirm and respond to diseases, conditions and health events that are responsible for  illness, deaths and disability in local communities.",booklet6,928
94,96,"The cost of good public health surveillance as a public health good is relatively very low compared to many other strategies. Let us all embrace these IDSR technical guidelines to strengthen capacities for preparedness, alert and response for health security in the country.",booklet6,274
95,97,"These guidelines are to be used by all relevant multisectoral stakeholders at all levels as general reference for surveillance activities, set of standard definitions for threshold levels that initiate action for responding to specific diseases, stand-alone reference for level-specific responsibilities, resource for developing training, supervision, monitoring and evaluation of surveillance activities, and as a guide for improving early detection and response of epidemic prone diseases.",booklet6,491
96,98,"Finally, I appeal to you all to ensure that the third edition of the IDSR technical guidelines are implemented within a broader context of health system strengthening; better coordination between human and animal health surveillance and other sectors involved in One Health approach; improved use of laboratory network capacity in surveillance and response; and better community engagement in public health interventions.",booklet6,421

115,117,"Background﷐In this sub-section, you will find general information about: The disease or event, the causative agent, geographic range affected and other epidemiologic information. Transmission routes such as person-to-person, unprotected contact with infectious body fluids or contaminated materials, vector-borne, and so on. Why the disease/event is a priority for surveillance. For example, the disease/event is responsible for a high number of deaths, disability and illness,  General and specific risk factors in African countries. Any additional background information that might serve the district surveillance team. ﷐Surveillance Goal﷐This sub-section states how the surveillance information is used for action. ﷐Standard case definition﷐Suspected case: A definition is provided for suspecting a case or outbreak of this disease or event. Probable case: A definition is provided for a suspected case with epidemiological link to a confirmed case or an outbreak if laboratory confirmation results are not available. Confirmed case: A definition is provided for classifying a case as confirmed through laboratory diagnostic testing. ﷐Respond to alert threshold Some diseases or events have program specific thresholds for alerting the health facility or district to a potential problem.  For epidemic-prone diseases, diseases targeted for elimination or eradication, or public health events of international concern, a single case is a suspected outbreak and requires immediate reporting followed by patient treatment, collection of specimens for case confirmation, and investigation of the case to determine the risk factors and potential interventions.  For other priority diseases of public health importance, an outbreak or event is suspected when there is any unusual cluster, pattern, or increase in the number of cases when compared with previous time periods. This should prompt a response such as investigating what might have caused the unusual events. If laboratory confirmation is indicated, specimens should be collected for laboratory confirmation. ﷐Respond to action threshold﷐For epidemic-prone diseases, diseases targeted for elimination or eradication, or public health events of international concern, a confirmed case should trigger a response such as conducting an emergency immunization activity, enhancing access to safe drinking water, community education campaigns, and improving case management. For other priority diseases of public health importance, a confirmed outbreak should prompt an appropriate response such as improving coverage for specified immunizations, strengthening case management, providing information, education and communication about preventing and controlling the disease, and so on. ﷐Analyse and interpret data﷐This sub-section contains generic information about the minimum data elements to collect, analyse and interpret. The key points to consider for interpreting the data and specific elements for analysis are also stated (time, place, and person).﷐Laboratory confirmation﷐In this sub-section, guidelines on laboratory confirmation are provided including: relevant diagnostic  tests, how to collect, store and transport the specimens needed for laboratory confirmation, and information on the results of laboratory work.﷐Reference﷐Appropriate references for further information stated for each disease. Most are available from the WHO website.",booklet6,3403
116,118,Acute haemorrhagic fever syndrome,booklet6,33
117,119,"Background﷐Acute haemorrhagic fever syndromes can be attributable to Ebola and Marburg viral diseases (Filoviridae);    Lassa fever (arenaviridae), Rift Valley fever (RVF) and Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever (CCHF) (Bunyaviridae); dengue (dengue haemorrhagic fever (DHF)) and yellow fever (Flaviviridae); and other viral, bacterial or rickettsial diseases with potential to produce epidemics. All cases of acute haemorrhagic fever syndrome whether single or in clusters, should be immediately notified without waiting for the causal agent to be identified.﷐Surveillance goal﷐Early detection of acute haemorrhagic fever syndrome cases and outbreaks, rapid investigation, and early laboratory verification of the cause of all suspected cases. Investigation of all suspected cases with contact tracing. During epidemics, most infected patients do not show haemorrhagic symptoms and a specific case definition according to the suspected or confirmed disease should be used (e.g. case definitions for Ebola-Marburg, CCHF, RVF, Lassa, DHF, and yellow fever).  ﷐Standard case definition﷐Suspected case: Acute onset of fever of less than 3 weeks duration in a severely ill patient/ or a dead person AND any 2 of the following; haemorrhagic or purpuric rash; epistaxis (nose bleed); haematemesis (blood in vomit); haemoptysis (blood in sputum); blood in stool; other haemorrhagic symptoms and no known predisposing factors for haemorrhagic manifestations OR clinical suspicion of any of the viral diseases. Probable case: A suspected case with epidemiologic link to confirmed cases or outbreak, but laboratory specimens are not available or awaited Confirmed case: A suspected case with laboratory confirmation. Note: During an outbreak, case definitions may be changed to correspond to the local event. It is important to note that during outbreaks, most cases might not show haemorrhagic manifestation, a proper history taking is crucial",booklet6,1931
118,120,"Respond to alert threshold﷐ If a single case is suspected: Report case-based information immediately to the appropriate levels. Suspected cases should be isolated from other patients/people and strict infection prevention procedures should be implemented. Standard precautions should be enhanced throughout the health care setting and in communities. Treat and manage the patient with supportive care. Collect the appropriate specimen while observing strict infection prevention and control procedures to confirm the case. Complete a laboratory request form, use triple packaging of the specimens (see detailed SOP for triple packaging) and mark well the containers to warn of a potential laboratory biosafety risk Conduct case-contact tracing and follow-up and active case search for additional cases (See detailed SOP for contact tracing and follow up). Begin or enhance death reporting and surveillance; as well as screening procedures for fever and VHD related symptoms ",booklet6,974
119,121,Acute haemorrhagic fever syndrome,booklet6,33
120,122,"Respond to action threshold﷐If a single case is confirmed: Maintain strict viral haemorrhagic disease (VHD) infection prevention and control (IPC) practices* throughout the outbreak. Mobilize the community for early detection and care and conduct community education about how the disease is transmitted and how to implement IPC in the home care setting and during funerals and burials. Consider social distancing strategies. Conduct case-contact follow-up and active searches for additional cases that may not come to the health care setting. Request additional help from other levels as needed. Establish an isolation ward or treatment centre to handle additional cases that may come to the health centre and ensure strict IPC measures to avoid transmission in health care settings. Suspected cases should be isolated and treated for more common conditions with similar symptoms, which might include malaria, typhoid, louse borne typhus, relapsing fever or leptospirosis. Ensure a barrier is instituted between suspected and confirmed cases. Provide psychosocial support for the family, community and staff. Consider quarantine for high risk contacts with home support during the incubation period and ensure daily follow up of their movements. There are promising vaccine candidates under development for some VHDs that might be useful to be used in the event of outbreak in a ring vaccination approach and for health care workers. Treat conservatively the symptoms which might be presented; severe cases require intensive support care; if dehydrated ensure fluid replacement with fluids that contain electrolytes. A range of potential treatment options including blood products, immune therapies, and drug therapies are currently being evaluated,﷐Analyse and interpret data﷐Person: Implement immediate case-based reporting of cases and deaths. Analyse age and sex distribution. Assess risk factors and plan outbreak response interventions accordingly. Time:Graph cases and deaths daily/weekly. Construct an epidemic curve during the outbreak. Place:Map locations of cases’ households and work sites. If you have a GPS gadget, this will add to understand exact location of the cases; as well as contacts.",booklet6,2207
121,123,"Laboratory confirmation: Acute haemorrhagic fever syndrome﷐Diagnostic test﷐Laboratory confirmed cases must test positive for the virus antigen, either by detection of virus RNA by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT- PCR), or by detection of IgM antibodies directed against Ebola/Marburg, CCHF, Lassa or West Nile Fever ﷐Specimen﷐For ELISA: Whole blood, serum or plasma  For RT-PCR: Whole blood or blood clot, serum/plasma or tissue For immunohisto-chemistry: Skin or tissue specimens from fatal cases NB: Rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs)o theoretically can be performed in any health care setting and without additional equipment, however, use of an RDT may result in both false positive and false negative test results. A nucleic-acid based (e.g., PCR) diagnostic assay, such as GeneXpert, must be used to confirm the RDT result. Recent guidance from WHO recommends that antigen detection RDT’s for VHDs have no role in the routine management of VHDs in settings where PCR testing is available.  However, they may have utility in settings without laboratory infrastructure and where specimens cannot be rapidly transported to a diagnostic laboratory, if their benefits and limitations are understood.﷐When to collect the specimen﷐Collect specimen from all suspected patients. All cases must be investigated, with contact tracing. Blood samples and appropriate clinical specimens must be collected to confirm a diagnosis as rapidly as possible.﷐How to prepare, store, and transport the specimen HANDLE AND TRANSPORT SPECIMENS FROM SUSPECTED VHF PATIENTS WITH EXTREME CAUTION. WEAR PROTECTIVE CLOTHING AND USE FULL PPE. For ELISA or PCR: Refrigerate serum or clot Freeze (-20oC or colder) tissue specimens for virus isolation For Immunohistochemistry: Fix skin snip specimen in formalin. Specimen can be stored up to 6 weeks. The specimen is not infectious once it is in formalin. Store at room temperature. Formalin-fixed specimens may be transported at room temperature.﷐Results Diagnostic services for VHF are not routinely available.

122,124,Acute and chronic viral hepatitis,booklet6,33
123,125,"Background﷐Viral hepatitis A and viral hepatitis E Enterically transmitted hepatitis A virus (HAV) and hepatitis E virus (HEV) are a worldwide problem. Common source epidemics have been related to contaminated water and to contamination via infected food handlers. In general, both HAV and HEV are self-limiting viral infections; case fatality is normally low (0.1 – 0.3%). Women in the third trimester of pregnancy are especially susceptible to fulminant HEV disease. Both HAV and HEV are transmitted via the faecal-oral route. Prevention and control measures for hepatitis A and hepatitis E include adequate supplies of safe-drinking water and improvement of sanitary and hygienic practices to eliminate faecal contamination of food and water. Viral hepatitis B and viral hepatitis C: Estimates indicate that worldwide, there are 257 million carriers of hepatitis B virus and 71 million carriers of hepatitis C virus. Acute Hepatitis B and C may be anicteric and thus unrecognized, but acute outbreaks are uncommon.  Chronic infection and severe sequelae occur with hepatitis B – an estimated 15% to 25% of chronically infected persons will die prematurely of either cirrhosis or hepatocellular carcinoma. Chronic Hepatitis C infection is also common and 5% to 20% of those infected with HCV may develop cirrhosis. The risk of hepatocellular carcinoma in persons with HCV cirrhosis is 2-4% per year.  Hepatitis B is transmitted by percutaneous or per mucosal exposure to blood or other infectious body fluids. In most countries where HBV is highly endemic, most acute infections occur during infancy, early childhood or via perinatal transmission from mother to infant. Other important routes of transmission include nosocomial exposure (transfusions, unsafe injection practices), shared needles or syringes among injecting drug users, household contact (e.g., communally used razors and toothbrushes) and sexual contact with an infected person.  Hepatitis C is transmitted by parenteral exposure to blood and plasma derivatives. It is found in highest concentrations in blood. The major causes of HCV infection worldwide are use of unscreened blood transfusions and re-use of needles and syringes that have not been adequately sterilized. Prevention and control measures for hepatitis B and C include transfusion safety, safe and appropriate use of injections and vaccination (hepatitis B). Screening and early treatment are efficient modes of secondary prevention. To address the increasing burden of viral hepatitis, in 2016, African member states adopted Prevention, Care and Treatment of viral hepatitis in the African Region: Framework for action 2016-2020 There is no specific treatment for acute viral hepatitis.",booklet6,2722

132,134,Anthrax (human),booklet6,15
133,135,"Background﷐Anthrax is a widespread zoonotic disease caused by the spore-forming bacterium Bacillus anthracis, a Gram positive rod-shaped bacterium. A. It is transmitted from infected domestic livestock (cattle, sheep, goats, buffaloes, pigs and others) or wild game animals to humans by direct contact or indirect contact with animals or their products. The incubation period typically ranges from 1 to 7 days, but may be longer (up to two to three weeks for cutaneous anthrax and up to 42 days for inhalation anthrax). Persons exposed to occupational hazards include those handling infected carcasses and those employed in the processing of bones, hides, wool and other animal products. Persons may also become infected by handling or consuming meat from animals that are sick with or have died of the disease. Biting flies have been reported to transmit the disease from infected animals to humans however how readily or often this occurs is unknown. Human anthrax is a serious problem in several countries and has potential for explosive outbreaks (especially the gastrointestinal form that is contracted from eating infected meat); while pulmonary (inhalation) anthrax is mainly occupational, the threat of biological warfare attacks should not be forgotten. Anthrax has a serious impact on the trade of animal products. The control of anthrax is based on its prevention in livestock. Programmes based only on prevention in humans are costly and likely to be ineffective except for those industrially exposed. There is an effective vaccine for those persons considered at risk for occupational exposure, and successful vaccines are used for livestock, particularly for herds with ongoing exposure to contaminated soil or vegetation. In most countries anthrax is a notifiable disease.﷐Surveillance goal﷐To detect outbreaks. To monitor control and prevention programmes",booklet6,1871

141,143,"Background﷐Neisseria meningitidis, Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib), and Streptococcus pneumoniae constitute the majority of all cases of bacterial meningitis and 90% of bacterial meningitis in children. Meningococcal meningitis is the main form of meningitis causing epidemics and remains a major public health challenge in the African meningitis belt, an area that extends from Senegal to Ethiopia. In these countries, large outbreaks may occur during the dry season (November through May). Outside of the meningitis belt, smaller outbreaks may occur year-round.  Epidemics in the meningitis belt were traditionally associated with Neisseria meningitidis serogroup A before the introduction of a meningococcal A conjugate vaccine (MACV) (MenAfriVac vaccine) into meningitis belt countries starting in 2010. MACV is immunogenic in both infants and adults and confers long-term protection. It has dramatically reduced the circulation of Nm A and eliminated Nm A epidemics. Epidemics from other serogroups continue to occur: since 2013 major epidemics due to Nm serogroup C occurred in Nigeria and Niger. From 2016 to 2018, major mixed epidemics of Neisseria meningitidis  serogroup W and Streptococcus pneumoniae have been reported in Ghana. In 2016 and 2017 Togo reported epidemics due to Nm serogroup W. In addition, in 2006 Burkina and Niger reported an epidemic due to Nm serogroup X. Human-to-human disease transmission is via large respiratory droplets from the nose and throats of infected people. Incubation period is 2 to 10 days. Attack rates are highest among children aged less than 15 years. Case fatality rates are usually 8-15% among treated patients, and >70% among untreated cases. Many survivors suffer long-term sequelae including mental retardation, hearing loss and loss of limb use. Ceftriaxone is the drug of choice for treatment during epidemics because it is effective on the predominant meningitis pathogens. In addition, antimicrobial resistance to ceftriaxone has not yet been detected in Africa. During epidemics in the meningitis belt, antibiotic prophylaxis is not recommended The current response to meningitis epidemics consists of reactive mass vaccination campaigns with bivalent (A C) or trivalent/quatrivalent polysaccharide vaccine (A, C, W/ A, C, Y W) as soon as possible after an epidemic has been declared. Polysaccharide vaccines do not protect very young children (<2 years) and only provide protection for up to three years. ﷐Surveillance goals﷐To promptly detect meningitis outbreaks and to confirm aetiology of meningitis outbreaks. To use the data to plan for treatment and vaccination supplies and other prevention and control measures. To assess and monitor the spread and progress of the epidemic and the effectiveness of control measures. To monitor the epidemiology of meningitis including serogroup shifts. To monitor antibiotic susceptibility.",booklet6,2900

153,155," Background﷐Chikungunya fever is a viral illness that is spread by the bite of infected mosquitoes. The disease resembles dengue fever, and is characterized by severe, sometimes persistent, joint pain (arthritis), as well as fever and rash. It is rarely life-threatening. Nevertheless, widespread occurrence of diseases causes substantial morbidity and economic loss. The word ""Chikungunya"" is Makonde for ""that which bends up,"" in reference to the stooped posture of patients afflicted with the severe joint pain associated with the disease. Epidemics of fever, rash and arthritis, resembling Chikungunya fever were recorded as early as 1779. However, the virus was first isolated between 1952-1953 from both man and mosquitoes during an epidemic in Tanzania. Chikungunya historically displayed interesting epidemiological profiles in that: major epidemics appeared and disappeared cyclically, usually with an inter-epidemic period of 7-8 years and sometimes as long as 20 years. After a long period of absence, outbreaks appeared in Indonesia in 1999 and have been virtually ongoing since 2004.﷐Surveillance goal﷐ Detect Chikungunya sporadic cases and outbreaks early, and seek laboratory verification.  Identify high risk areas in order to improve prevention of outbreaks by taking steps to avoid mosquito bites and elimination of breeding sites.﷐Standard case definition ﷐Acute clinical case Clinical criterion: Fever >38.50 C (101.30F) and joint pain a (usually incapacitating b) with acute onset      AND  Epidemiological criterion: resident or visitor in areas with local transmission of Chikungunya on the last 15 days (suspected case for epidemiological surveillance)    OR Laboratory criterion: confirmation by laboratory: PCR, serology or viral culture (confirmed case for epidemiological surveillance) Atypical case Clinical case of laboratory confirmed Chikungunya accompanied by other manifestations: neurological, cardiological, dermatological, ophthalmological, hepatic, renal, respiratory, or haematological, among others. Severe acute case Clinical case of laboratory-confirmed chikungunya presenting dysfunction of at least one organ or system that threatens life and requires hospitalization Suspected and confirmed chronic cases Suspect chronic case: Person with previous clinical diagnosis of chikungunya after 12 weeks of the onset of the symptoms presenting with at least one of the following articular manifestations: pain, rigidity, or edema, continuously or recurrently.   Confirmed chronic case: Every chronic case with a positive chikungunya laboratory test     a Usually accompanied by exanthema, myalgia, back pain, headache and, occasionally, vomiting and diarrhoea (pediatric age        group).   b In children aged <3 years, joint pain is expressed as inconsolable crying, irritability, rejection to mobilization and/or walking.﷐ Respond to alert threshold﷐If Chikungunya cases are suspected: Report case-based information immediately to the next level Collect specimens for confirming the cases Conduct an investigation to determine the risk factors for transmission Manage and treat the cases using acetaminophen or paracetamol to relieve fever and non-steroidal anti- inflammatory agents﷐Respond to action threshold﷐If Chikungunya cases are confirmed Symptomatic treatment for mitigating pain and fever using non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs along with rest usually suffices.

The disease is transmitted mainly through the faecal-oral route; that is through eating or drinking contaminated food or water. Cholera causes over 100 000 deaths per year. It may produce rapidly progressive epidemics or worldwide pandemics. In endemic areas, sporadic cases (less than 5% of all non-outbreak-related diarrhoea cases) and small outbreaks may occur. Incubation period is from a few hours to 5 days, usually in the range of from 2 to 3 days. There has been a resurgence of cholera in Africa since the mid-1980s, where over 80% of the world’s cases occurred in 1999. The majority of cases occurred from January through April. In 2016, globally, 38 countries reported a total of 132 121 cases. Of cases reported globally, 54% were from Africa, 13% from Asia and 32% from Hispaniola. Imported cases were reported in 9 countries. Cholera may cause severe dehydration in only a few hours. In untreated patients with severe dehydration, the case fatality rate (CFR) may exceed 50%. If patients present at the health facility and correct treatment is received, the CFR is usually less than 1%. At least 90% of the cases are mild, and they remain undiagnosed. Risk factors: eating or drinking contaminated foods such as uncooked seafood or shellfish from estuarine waters, lack of continuous access to safe water and food supplies, attending large gatherings of people including ceremonies such as weddings or funerals, contact with persons who died of cholera. Other enteric diarrhoea may cause watery diarrhoea, especially in children less than 5 years of age.

161,163,"Background﷐﷐Dengue fever is an arbovirus transmitted by aedes mosquitoes (both Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopiticus). Dengue is caused by four serologically distinct, but closely related viruses: dengue virus (DENV) 1, 2, 3, and 4 of the Flaviviridae family. Dengue fever is an emerging pandemic that has spread globally during the past 30 years as a result of changes in human ecology. Dengue is found in tropical and sub-tropical regions around the world, predominately in urban and semi-urban areas. During dengue epidemics, infection rates among those who have not been previously exposed to the virus are often 40% to 50%, but can reach 80% to 90%. Dengue fever is a severe, influenza-like illness that affects infants, young children and adults, but seldom causes death. Dengue haemorrhagic fever (DHF) is a potentially deadly complication that has become a leading cause of hospitalization and death among children in Asia. There is good evidence that sequential infection with the different serotypes of dengue virus increases the risk of more severe disease that can result in dengue shock syndrome (DSS) and death. Epidemic dengue activity in Africa has mostly been classical dengue fever caused by DENV-1 and DENV-2 without associated mortality. The first major outbreak of DENV-3 in Africa was documented in Mozambique in 1984-1985. During this outbreak, most patients experienced secondary infections and 2 deaths were attributed to DHF and shock. In 2008, yellow fever and DENV-3 were found to be co-circulating in Abidjan, Cote d’Ivoire, however, no severe dengue cases or deaths attributable to dengue were identified. There is no specific treatment for dengue, but appropriate medical care frequently saves the lives of patients with dengue haemorrhagic fever. Infected humans are the main carriers and multipliers of the virus, serving a source of the virus for uninfected Aedes aegypti mosquitoes which maintain the urban dengue transmission cycle. The virus circulates in the blood of infected human for 2-7 days, at approximately the same time that they have a fever. A sylvatic transmission cycle has been documented in west Africa where DENV-2 has been found in monkeys. There is no evidence of person-to-person transmission. At present, the only method of controlling or preventing dengue virus transmission is to combat the vector mosquitoes using environmental management and chemical methods.   ﷐﷐Surveillance goal﷐Surveillance for suspected cases and investigation of clusters of suspected cases in areas with Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopiticus mosquitoes﷐ Standard case definition: Dengue Fever﷐Dengue Fever Suspected case: Any person with acute febrile illness of 2-7 days duration with 2 or more of the following: headache, retro-orbital pain, myalgia, arthralgia, rash, haemorrhagic manifestations, leucopenia. Dengue Fever Confirmed case: A suspected case with laboratory confirmation (positive IgM antibody, four-fold or greater rise in IgG antibody titres, positive PCR or viral isolation). Dengue Haemorrhagic Fever: A probable or confirmed case of dengue with bleeding tendencies as evidenced by one or more of the following: positive tourniquet test; petechieae, ecchymoses or purpura; bleeding: mucosa, gastrointestinal tract, injection sites or other; haematemesis or melaena; and thrombocytopenia (100 000 cells or less per mm3) and evidence of plasma leakage due to increased vascular permeability, manifested by one or more of the following: 20% rise in average haematocrit for age and sex, 20% drop in haematocrit following volume replacement therapy compared to baseline, signs of plasma leakage (pleural effusion, ascites, hypo-proteinaemia). Dengue Shock Syndrome: All the above criteria, plus evidence of circulatory failure manifested by rapid and weak pulse, and narrow pulse pressure (≤ 20 mm Hg) or hypotension for age, cold, clammy skin and altered mental status.﷐﷐Respond to alert threshold: Dengue Fever﷐If a single case is suspected: Report case-based information immediately to the next level. Conduct active search for additional cases Collect specimens for confirming the cases﷐Respond to action threshold﷐If a single case is confirmed: Report case-based information immediately to the next level and initiate a line list/register of suspected cases Conduct active search for additional cases Collect specimens for confirming the cases and ensure results are linked with cases Survey the community to determine the abundance of vector mosquitoes, identify the most productive larval habitats, promote and implement plans for their elimination, management or treatment with appropriate larvicides. Educate the public and promote behaviours to remove, destroy or manage mosquito vector larval habitats. Manage and provide supportive treatment to dengue fever cases.

163,165,"Background﷐Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a widespread chronic disease that occurs when the pancreas does not produce enough insulin, or when the body cannot effectively use the insulin it produces. Diabetes can cause serious health complications including heart disease, blindness, kidney failure, and lower-extremity amputations. The most common form is Type 2 diabetes that represents more than 85% of the cases. Other forms are less common such as Type 1 (10% of cases), specific diabetes and gestational diabetes (5% of cases). The risk factors that affect the onset of diabetes are well-known. They comprise non-modifiable factors like old age (over 45 years of age), family history, and the causes of diabetes in pregnancy. Modifiable risk factors for diabetes are obesity, physical inactivity and excessive alcohol consumption. The global prevalence in 2000 was estimated at 2.8%, with projections of 4.8% by 2030. The total number of persons affected will rise from 171 million in 2000 to 366 million in 2030 if no action is taken. Annual mortality linked to diabetes worldwide is estimated at more than one million. Diabetes is no longer considered rare in Africa. Recent estimates based on the WHO STEP-wise approach for monitoring the risk factors of non-communicable diseases indicate prevalence of between 1% and 20%. In some countries such as Mauritius, it reaches 20%. The rate of limb amputations due to diabetes varies from 1.4% to 6.7% of diabetic foot cases. In some African countries, the mortality rate is higher than 40 per 10,000 inhabitants. In the African Region, efforts made to create an environment that enhances the fight against diabetes include adoption of resolutions on non-communicable diseases in 2000, cardiovascular diseases strategy in 2005, and diabetes mellitus strategy in 2007. The World Health Organization and the International Diabetes Federation (IDF) have also jointly carried out actions to contribute to promoting diabetes awareness in Africa.﷐Surveillance goal﷐Estimate the magnitude of the disease Monitor trends and risk factors Identify populations at highest risk (e.g.; age groups, urban vs. rural) Monitor prevention and control program activities",booklet6,2199

172,174,Dracunculiasis (Guinea Worm Disease),booklet6,36
173,175," Background﷐Dracunculiasis is commonly known as Guinea worm disease. It is caused by a large nematode, a disabling parasite that emerges through the skin of the infected person. This is an old disease, known since antiquity, inflicting an excruciating pain on affected individuals and usually causing temporary disability, leaving many patients with unfortunate socio-economic consequences. It is transmitted through ingestion of water containing a crustacean (cyclops) which is infested by an immature form (larvae) of the nematode. The Cyclops is found in stagnant surface water sources (ponds, traditional shallow wells). The female nematode discharges larvae from the host’s skin when there is contact with water. The incubation period is usually between 10 to 14 months. There is no treatment or vaccine against the disease. Successful disease elimination strategies conducted by the endemic countries and an international coalition of partners has pushed Dracunculiasis towards eradication. During 2017, only 30 cases of Guinea worm disease worldwide were reported to WHO, compared to 892 000 in 1989, showing a reduction of 99.99%. In 1989, the disease was endemic in 20 countries: Benin, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Côte d’Ivoire, Chad, Ghana, Ethiopia, India, Pakistan, Kenya, Mali, Mauritania, Niger, Nigeria, Sudan, Senegal, Togo, Uganda and Yemen. Africa remains the only affected continent, with 5 countries having reported infection emanating from indigenous transmission of the parasite either in human and/or in animal in 2018: Angola, Chad, Ethiopia, Mali and South Sudan. Since, 2012, emerging worms from animals, mostly dogs, and in a few instances, cats and baboons, have been reported in some of the remaining endemic countries and confirmed in the WHO Collaborating Centre at CDC for Dracunculiasis Eradication laboratory, as Dracunculus medinensis.

Major Ebola outbreaks have occurred in Sudan, DRC, Cote d’Ivoire, Gabon, Uganda and Congo. More than 500 cases of Marburg with over 400 deaths were reported during outbreaks of Marburg virus that occurred in DRC (1998-2000), Angola (2004-2005) and Uganda (3 cases in 2007). These two viruses are transmitted by direct contact with the blood, secretions, organs or other body fluids of infected persons. The infection of humans with Ebola virus through the handling of infected chimpanzees, gorillas, and forest antelopes (alive and dead) has been documented. Ecological studies are in progress to identify the natural reservoirs of both Marburg and Ebola. There is evidence that fruit bats are involved. Epidemics can be dramatically amplified in health care facilities with inadequate infection control precautions/barrier nursing procedures. Incubation period for Ebola and Marburg is 2 to 21 days. Between 20% and 80% of patients have haemorrhagic manifestations depending on the Ebola or Marburg virus strain. Patients become increasingly infectious as their illness progresses. High case fatality ratios have been reported during Ebola outbreaks (25% to 90%) and during Marburg outbreaks (25% to 80%) There is no specific treatment for either disease. Severe cases require intensive supportive care, as patients are frequently dehydrated and in need of intravenous fluids or oral rehydration with solutions containing electrolytes. Close contact with a severely ill patient, during care at home or in hospital, and certain burial practices are common routes of infection.

180,182,"Background﷐Epilepsy is defined as the recurrence of, at least, two epileptic seizures with sudden occurrence of abnormal signs which could be: motor, tonic, sensitive, sensorial, neuro-vegetative, or psycho-behavioural. These symptoms could or could not be associated to a loss of conscience. It can appear at any age. Epilepsy is the most common result of brain cells disturbance that lead to excessive nerve-cell discharges. According to the disturbance on some or many groups of cells, seizures could be partial or generalized. Seizures with tonic-clonic muscle movements are named convulsion or fit or attack. Convulsion can appear at any age; all convulsions are not systematically epilepsy. Epilepsy is frequent in the Region and its prevalence rate range from 2.2 to 58 per 1000 persons. Studies from five sub-Saharan African countries showed an incidence ranging from 64 to 156 per 100,000 person/year. This higher incidence may be a consequence of many risk factors which are related with predisposing factors such as poor perinatal care, head trauma, consanguinity. Many etiological factors are related with communicable diseases (malaria, tuberculosis, meningitis, neurocysticerocisis and HIV), non-communicable diseases (high blood pressure, diabetes, alcoholism and illicit drug use), poorer medical facilities, poorer general health and a lower standard of living. Misunderstanding linked to cultural beliefs, sigma and exclusion do not facilitate appropriate care. Epilepsy substantially increases mortality risk, particularly in conditions of later detection due to lack of well-trained health workers to diagnose and treat neurological disorders. Death and injury occur primarily due to status epilepticus (especially in the case of abrupt medication withdrawal), burns and drowning.  It has been estimated that in developing countries, up to 80% of people with epilepsy are not receiving treatment, or are often not even identified. While the etiological diagnosis of the epilepsies may be more difficult in developing countries, due to limited investigative resources, many can be diagnosed on the basis of simple clinical and epidemiological knowledge.﷐",booklet6,2173

In addition to diseases listed elsewhere in this guideline such as cholera, and shigellosis, surveillance for foodborne illnesses may involve other causes such as salmonellosis, hepatitis A or chemical contamination. A foodborne illness occurs when two or more people have shared common food or drink followed by an onset of symptoms within a short time period. Most people with a foodborne illness do not seek medical care, so cases and outbreaks of foodborne illness usually are neither recognized nor reported. The first symptoms often occur in gastrointestinal tract. Nausea, vomiting, abdominal cramps and diarrhoea are frequent symptoms of foodborne diseases. Outbreaks may be localized affecting as few as 2 individuals who ate a common meal or product, but large and geographically widespread outbreaks may also occur. Large outbreaks occur when food is contaminated prior to distribution and is widely consumed by many people in many areas. Surveillance for foodborne illnesses is needed to monitor food safety and target health promotion actions aimed at food handlers for safer food practices and improved personal hygiene.﷐Surveillance Goal﷐To promptly identify any unusual cluster of disease potentially transmitted through food, which may need a public health investigation or response. Monitor the magnitude of foodborne illnesses Identify high risk foods or food practices. Monitor risk factors to inform public health interventions and health promotion for targeted foods or food practices.﷐Standard case definition: Foodborne illness﷐A foodborne illness is suspected when 2 or more people present with similar symptoms and who consumed common food or drink A foodborne illness is defined according to the specific agent causing the disease (for example, cholera, hepatitis A, salmonellosis, shigellosis). A confirmed foodborne illness is a laboratory confirmed case of a specific agent with a link to a common food or drink source.﷐Respond to alert threshold: Foodborne illness﷐If observed that ≥2 people are ill and have eaten food from a common source: Immediately report the illness to the next level of the heath system From patients and from the suspected food items and drinks, collect specimens for laboratory confirmation Treat suspected cases﷐Respond to action threshold: Foodborne illness﷐If an outbreak of a foodborne illness is confirmed: Search for additional cases in locality of confirmed cases Strengthen case management and treatment Mobilise community for rapid case detection and treatment Identify high risk groups Remove from the restaurant menu or the supermarkets shelves, food items from which evidence of unsafe food may be obtained. Eventually call for in-depth investigation of the food chains that may be associated with the outbreak Reduce sporadic and outbreak-related cases by promoting handwashing with soap and water after defecating/urinating and before food handling/meals; strengthen access to safe water supply and storage, use of latrines and safe human waste disposal Scale-up food safety health promotion activities using the WHO Five Keys to Safer Food (see reference below) and the Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point (HACCP) system Scale-up food inspection activities﷐Analyse and interpret data: Foodborne illness﷐Time: Graph monthly trends in cases and deaths; Construct an epidemic curve for outbreak cases. Place: Plot location of households for cases and deaths Person: Count cases and deaths each month.

186,188,"Background﷐Hypertension or high blood pressure (HBP) is a chronic condition in which the blood pressure in the arteries is elevated. It is classified as either primary (essential) or secondary. ‘Primary’ hypertension is elevated blood pressure where no medical cause is found. ‘Secondary’ hypertension is caused by other conditions that affect the arteries, heart, endocrine system or kidneys. Hypertension is a major risk factor for cardiovascular diseases such as heart attack or stroke. According to The World Health Report 2001, cardiovascular disease related deaths are increasing in the African Region, and in 2000 accounted for 9.2% of the total deaths in the African Region. Prevalence ranges from 25% to 35% in adults aged 25 to 64 years. Hypertension affects approximately 1 billion worldwide and it is estimated that more than 20 million people in the African Region are affected. Major risk factors for hypertension are ageing, lack of physical activity, obesity, and a diet high in salt and fat. Other risk factors include; tobacco and alcohol use. Lifestyle modifications shown to lower BP include; weight reduction for individuals who are overweight or obese, reducing the amount of fat and salt in the diet, and eating more fresh fruits and vegetables, increased physical activity, and reduction of alcohol and tobacco consumption.﷐Surveillance goal﷐Prevention of secondary illness by early detection and standardized treatment Estimation of disease burden and reduction of identified risk factors Monitor control and prevention activities﷐Standard case definition﷐Suspected new case at first visit: Any individual presenting with a resting blood pressure measurement (based on the average of 3 readings) at or above 140 mm Hg for systolic pressure, or greater than or equal to 90 mm Hg for diastolic pressure. Confirmed case: Any individual presenting on at least two occasions with a resting blood pressure measurement (based on the average of 3 readings) at or above 140 mm Hg for systolic pressure, or greater than or equal to 90 mm Hg for diastolic pressure. * Report only the first diagnosis of the case in the health centre﷐Recommended public health action: Hypertension﷐Health promotion for non-communicable diseases focusing on HBP should be established, including community-based education on behaviour change and adoption of healthy lifestyles Promote secondary prevention and treatment interventions at health facilities according to national guidelines.﷐Analyse and interpret data﷐Time: Graph cases quarterly to analyse trends. Place: Compare district trends with national and regional trends. Person: Analyse the distribution of cases by age and other demographic factors.    *Data for non-communicable diseases is often analysed for long term trends﷐Laboratory confirmation﷐Diagnostic is clinical.﷐Reference﷐WHO, Atlas of heart disease and stroke, Geneva, World Health Organization, 2004. Non communicable Diseases: A strategy for the African Region, AFR/RC50/10 Cardiovascular Diseases in the African Region: Current situation and perspectives, AFR/RC55/12 http://www.who.int/chp/steps/en/ http://www.afro.who.int/dnc/databases/afro infobase/index.html WHO CVD-risk management package for low-and medium resource settings. The Seventh Report of the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure U.S. Department of health and Human Services, National Institutes of Health, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, NIH Publication No. 03-5233, December 2003 Handbook of Hypertension, Vol 20.

187,189,Influenza caused by a new subtype,booklet6,33
188,190,"Background﷐An influenza pandemic occurs when a new influenza A virus emerges with efficient and sustained human-to-human transmission in populations with limited immunity. Influenza pandemics occurred in 1918, 1957 and 1968; 2009. The 1918 pandemic killed an estimated 40–50 million people. It is predicted that a pandemic of equivalent magnitude could kill 62 million people, 96% of them in developing countries. Influenza caused by new subtype were reported in i) 1997/human infections with the A(H5N1) virus HPAI; ii) 2009/Influenza A (H1N1) pandemic; iii) 2013/human infections with A(H7N9) virus. Other avian influenza viruses have resulted in sporadic human infections including the A(H7N7) and A(H9N2) viruses. Some countries have also reported sporadic human infections with swine influenza viruses, particularly the A(H1) and A(H3) subtypes.  Successful mitigation or control of pandemic influenza is dependent on early recognition of sustained human-to-human transmission of a new influenza A virus. Countries have been encouraged as part of pandemic preparedness planning to enhance surveillance to (i) detect the emergence of new disease; (ii) characterize the disease (epidemiology, clinical manifestations, severity); and (iii) monitor its evolution and start control measures. Under the IHR (2005), a State Party is to immediately notify WHO of any laboratory confirmed case of a recent human infection caused by an influenza A virus with the potential to cause a pandemic. Evidence of illness is not required for this report.﷐Surveillance goals﷐To detect and investigate the first evidence of sustained human-to-human transmission of an influenza virus with pandemic potential. To assess the earliest cases of pandemic influenza occurring in a country in order to characterize the new disease including its clinical characteristics, risk factor information, and epidemiological and virological features. To monitor the course of the pandemic within the country, regionally and globally.﷐﷐Standard case definitions: Influenza caused by a new subtype 1-For infections with other non-seasonal influenza viruses, case definitions must be adapted to the situation. The following case definitions are proposed for further adaptation: Suspected case: Fever (temperature >38⁰C) and [cough or shortness of breath or difficulty breathing] with onset within the last 10 days in a person with one or more of the following epidemiological exposures in the 2 weeks prior to symptom onset in [Area X] since/during [date Y/date Y to Zb]. Close contact (within 1metres) with a person who is a suspected, probable, or confirmed case; Exposure to animals or their remains or to environments contaminated by their faeces in an area where non-seasonal influenza infections in animals or humans have been suspected or confirmed in the last month;  Consumption of raw or undercooked animal’s products in an area where influenza infections in animals or humans have been suspected or confirmed in the last month;  Close contact with a confirmed influenza infected animal;  Handling samples suspected of containing non-seasonal influenza virus in a laboratory or other setting Probable case:   A suspected case with either:  positive laboratory confirmation of influenza A virus infection but insufficient laboratory evidence for subtype  A person dying of an unexplained acute respiratory illness who is considered to be epidemiologically linked to a probable or confirmed case of non-seasonal influenza in a human. Confirmed case: Laboratory confirmation of a recent d infection with non-seasonal influenza virus in a person  Discarded case: A suspected or probable case with a negative test of the non-seasonal influenza virus﷐b where one case has been confirmed, set start date at least 28 days (2 maximum incubation periods) prior to onset of first confirmed case c Whose non-seasonal influenza virus test results are accepted by WHO as confirmatory.    d   An infection is considered recent if it has been confirmed by positive results from polymerase chain reaction (PCR), virus isolation, or paired acute and convalescent serologic tests. An antibody titre in a single serum is often not enough to confirm a recent infection, and should be assessed by reference to valid WHO case definitions for human infections with specific influenza A subtypes. Standard Case Definitions: Influenza caused by a new subtype 2-For some zoonotic influenza subtypes, specific cases definitions exist such as for H5N1 and H7N9.  Link of the WHO H5N1 case definitions: http://www.who.int/influenza/resources/documents/case_definition2006_08_29/en/ Link of the WHO H7N9 case definitions: https://www.who.int/influenza/human_animal_interface/influenza_h7n9/en/ 3-IHR case definition for human influenza caused by a new subtype An influenza A virus is considered to have the potential to cause a pandemic if the virus has demonstrated the capacity to infect a human and if the heamagglutinin gene (or protein) is not a variant or mutated form of those, i.e. A/H1 or A/H3, circulating widely in the human population. An infection is considered recent if it has been confirmed by positive results from polymerase chain reaction (PCR), virus isolation, or paired acute and convalescent serologic tests. An antibody titre in a single serum is often not enough to confirm a recent infection, and should be assessed by reference to valid WHO case definitions for human infections with specific influenza A subtypes.﷐Respond to alert threshold: Influenza caused by a new subtype Respond to a suspected case of human influenza caused by a new subtype or to an unusual event of severe acute respiratory infection:   Triggers for investigation   Examples of triggers include:  respiratory disease in humans that is associated with recent exposure to animals; clusters1 of severe acute respiratory infection2 (SARI) or pneumonia in families, workplaces or social networks; SARI occurring in a health-care worker who cares for patients with respiratory diseases; SARI or pneumonia in travellers from countries or areas affected by emerging acute respiratory infections; SARI occurring in a laboratory worker or researcher handling novel influenza and other emerging respiratory pathogens; number of respiratory disease hospitalizations or deaths greater than expected; laboratory detection of human infection with a non-seasonal influenza virus or a novel respiratory pathogen; abrupt, unexplained changes in the trends of respiratory disease occurrence or clinical outcomes observed in routine surveillance activities; and unusually high levels of sales of pharmaceuticals used for respiratory illness that cannot be explained by known or expected disease trends.  1 A “cluster” is defined as two or more people with onset of symptoms within the same 14-day period and who are associated with a specific setting, such as a classroom, workplace, household, extended family, hospital, other residential institution, military barracks or recreational camp. 2SARI is an acute respiratory infection with history of fever or measured fever of ≥38 C⁰ and cough, with onset within the past 10 days, that requires hospitalization ﷐Key steps for an investigation: Influenza caused by a new subtype Prepare for the investigation - Assemble a multidisciplinary investigation team - Inform relevant authorities - Gather information and supplies Investigate initial cases reported Protect the investigators Develop case definitions Find additional cases - Identify and monitor contacts of cases - Active case finding Enhance surveillance Collect specimens Undertake animal health and environmental investigations Manage and analyse the data (time, place, person) Some public health questions that may require complementary studies to be implemented Implement response and control measures - Manage the sick - Prevent further transmission - Infection prevention and control - Communicate the risk - Monitor the event and the response Report and notify - Report results of the investigation - Notify to local, subnational and national public health authorities. ﷐Respond to action threshold: Influenza caused by a new subtype﷐If a single case of human influenza caused by a new subtype is confirmed or if another acute respiratory disease of epidemic or pandemic potential is confirmed: Manage the sick  Prevent further transmission Infection prevention and control Communicate the risk  Monitor the event and the response: An event is deemed to be contained if active surveillance in the at-risk population has not yielded new cases during twice the presumed incubation period for that disease   Refer for more details to WHO protocol to investigate non-seasonal influenza and other emerging acute         respiratory diseases, 2018 https://www.who.int/influenza/resources/publications/outbreak_investigation_protocol/en/  ",booklet6,8874

192,194,"Background﷐Respiratory infections are a significant cause of infectious disease morbidity and mortality in the world. The mortality rates are particularly high among infants, children and the elderly. However, the burden of disease is not well characterized in Africa.  The most common pathogens causing respiratory infections are; Streptococcus pneumonia, Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib), Staphylococcus aureus and other bacterial species, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), measles virus, human parainfluenza viruses type 1, 2, and 3 (PIV-1, PIV-2 and PIV-3), influenza virus An improved understanding of the epidemiology and seasonality of respiratory infections in Africa is essential for optimizing public health strategies for their prevention and control (e.g., vaccines and antivirals for prophylaxis and treatment, infection control). The threat of respiratory infections due to novel organisms that have epidemic or pandemic potential warrants special precautions and preparedness.  Surveillance for respiratory infections, mainly the viral ones, is based on the Influenza-like Illness (ILI) case definition. ﷐Surveillance goals﷐Describe the seasonality of influenza  Signal the start and end of the influenza season Establish baseline or average levels of influenza and severe influenza-related disease Describe circulating viruses Identify locally circulating virus types and subtypes and their relationship to global and regional patterns Monitor antiviral sensitivity Identify and monitor groups at high-risk of severe disease and complications from infection Assist in understanding the relationship of virus strains to disease severity Generate influenza data that can be used to estimate influenza burden Detect unusual and unexpected events ﷐Standard case definition﷐An acute respiratory infection with: measured fever ≥ 38 ºC  cough with onset within the last 10 days﷐Respond to an alert threshold: Influenza-like Illness (ILI)﷐Please refer to the WHO protocol to investigate non-seasonal influenza and other emerging acute respiratory diseases, 2018, if there is an unusual event (clusters of acute respiratory infections or of atypical respiratory infections, a cluster of deaths, for example) of respiratory infection. ﷐Respond to an action threshold: Influenza-like Illness (ILI)﷐Please refer to the WHO protocol to investigate non-seasonal influenza and other emerging acute respiratory diseases, 2018, if a single case of pandemic-prone acute respiratory disease is suspected.﷐Analyse and interpret data﷐Time: Frequency of reporting: Epidemiological and virological data collected from the sentinel sites should be analysed on a weekly basis.

195,197,"Background﷐Injury is a physical damage resulting when the human body is briefly or suddenly subjected to levels of energy exceeding its physiological tolerance or the impairment in function resulting from the lack of one or more vital elements (water, air, warmth). The energy causing the injury can be mechanical, electrical, thermal, radiant or chemical. Injury is classified as intentional and unintentional. All injuries account for 10% of the world’s deaths. 5.8 million People die each year as a result of different types of injuries. Of the all systems that people have to deal with on a daily basis; road transport is the most complex and the most dangerous. Road traffic accidents result in unintentional injury. A traffic collision (motor vehicle collision, motor vehicle accident, car accident, or car crash) occurs when a road vehicle collides with another vehicle, pedestrian, animal, road debris, or other geographical or architectural obstacle. Traffic collisions can result in injury, property damage, and death. Worldwide, the number of people killed in road traffic crashes each year is estimated at 1.2 million, while the number of injured could be as high as 50 million. Road traffic injuries are a major but neglected global public health problem, requiring concerted efforts for effective and sustainable prevention. Road traffic injuries continue to be among the leading causes of death and disability among young people aged between 5 and 44 years and the leading cause of death in the category of people between 15-29 years. The majority of such deaths are currently among “vulnerable road users”-pedestrians, pedal cyclists and motorcyclists. Without increased efforts and new initiatives, the total number of road traffic deaths worldwide and injuries is forecast to rise by some 67% by 2020, and in low income and middle-income countries deaths are expected to increase by as much as 83% The African region has the highest fatality rate for road traffic crashes at 32/100 000 population Road traffic injuries are preventable.

197,199,"Background﷐Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever (CCHF) virus belongs to the Bunyaviridae virus family and Lassa fever belongs to the Arenaviridae family. CCHF is endemic in parts of Africa and outbreaks have been reported from Uganda, Mauritania, and South Africa. Mauritania reports a few cases each year and South Africa reported 165 laboratory-confirmed cases between 1981 and March 2006. Lassa fever is known to be endemic in Guinea, Liberia, Nigeria and Sierra Leone, but probably exists in other West African countries as well. Some studies indicate that 300,000 to 500,000 Lassa fever cases with 5,000 deaths occur each year in West Africa. CCHF spreads to humans either by tick-bites, or through contact with viraemic animal tissue immediately post-slaughter. The animal reservoir of the Lassa virus is a rodent of the genus Mastomys. Mastomys infected with Lassa virus do not become ill but shed the virus in their excreta (urine and faeces) and humans usually become infected through aerosol or direct contact with excreta of infected rodents. Lassa fever can also be spread between humans through direct contact with the blood, pharyngeal secretions, urine, faeces or other body secretions of an infected person. Person-to-person transmission of both CCHF and Lassa fever viruses has occurred in health care settings after exposure to blood and secretions of infected patients. The incubation period for CCHF following a tick bite is usually 1-3 days (maximum 9 days) and following contact with blood or tissues is usually 5-6 days (maximum 13 days). The incubation period for Lassa fever ranges from 6-21 days. The onset of symptoms among CCHF patients is sudden with fever, myalgia and other signs and symptoms. The reported case fatality ratio for CCHF is between 3% and 30%. About 80% of human Lassa fever infections are mild or asymptomatic; the remaining cases have severe multi-system disease. The onset of disease in symptomatic patients is usually gradual starting with fever, general weakness and malaise. Lassa fever is difficult to distinguish from many other diseases which cause fever, including malaria, shigellosis, typhoid fever, yellow fever and other VHFs. The overall case fatality ratio ranges from 1 to 15% among hospitalized patients. General supportive therapy is the mainstay of patient management in CCHF.

198,200,Leprosy,booklet6,7
199,201,"Background﷐Leprosy is a chronic mycobacterial disease of the skin, the peripheral nerves and upper airway mucous membranes. The disease is transmitted mainly through airborne spread from nasal secretions of patients infected by Hansen’s bacillus (Mycobacterium leprae) and also through inoculation into broken skin. Leprosy is endemic in several tropical areas around the world, including Africa. Patients are classified into two groups, depending on presence of skin and nerve signs: Multibacillary patients (MB) with more than 5 skin patches and several nerve enlargements. Paucibacillary patients (PB) with one to five skin patches and a single nerve enlargement. Leprosy control has improved greatly through use of WHO recommended multidrug therapy (MDT). MDT combining two or three drugs (rifampicin, clofaximine and dapsone) is very effective in curing leprosy. At the end of 1999, leprosy point prevalence in African countries was 1.6 cases per 10 000 population with about 70 000 registered cases. Seventeen years later, at the end of 2016, this prevalnec rate was reduced to 0.25 cases per 10 000 population and les than 25 000 registered cases  Incubation period is 6 months to 20 years or more. Infection is probably frequent but clinical disease is rare, even among the closest contacts of patients. Multibacillary patients are most contagious, but infectiousness is reduced rapidly as soon as multiple drug therapy begins. Leprosy can be complicated by neuritis and leprosy reactions, resulting in impairment and disabilities of hands, feet, and eyes. Leprosy has historically been associated with social isolation and psychosocial consequences. This social stigma still persists in some countries in Africa. Some skin diseases such as tinea versicolor, mycosis, vitiligo, Scleroderma, psoriasis, systemic lupus erythematosus and Von Recklinghausen disease may be mistaken for leprosy.﷐Surveillance goal﷐Observe national trends towards the leprosy elimination target, defined as a reduction in prevalence to less than 1 new case with grade-2 disabilities per 1 000 000 population. Monitor resistance of Hansen’s bacillus to drugs used for MTD on an ongoing basis. As leprosy nears elimination, supplement routine surveillance with community-based surveillance, including active case search among household contacts of leprosy patients, especially during mass medicine administration or immunization campaigns.﷐Standard case definition﷐Suspected case: A person showing one of three cardinal signs of leprosy: hypo-pigmented or reddish skin lesion, loss or decrease of sensations in skin patch, enlargement or peripheral nerve. Confirmed case: A person showing at least two cardinal signs of leprosy and who has not completed a full course of treatment with multidrug therapy (MDT).﷐Respond to alert threshold: Leprosy ﷐If a single case is suspected: Report the suspected case to the appropriate level of the health system. Investigate case for risk factors. Begin appropriate case management: --MB patients must be treated for 12 months with a three-drug regimen (12 MB blister packs to be taken in a period of 18 months). --PB patients must be treated for 6 months with a two drugs MDT regimen ( 6 PB blister packs to be taken in a period of 9 months)﷐Respond to action threshold﷐If a suspected case is confirmed: Examine patients for skin and nerve signs at each contact patient has with a health worker to diagnose and care for leprosy reactions and impairments. Examine risk factors for treatment interruption (for example, inadequate supplies of MDT in the health centre, poor accessibility of patients’ villages, and so on). Give sufficient blister packs for a full course of treatment to patients unable to attend a health centre monthly. Identify any fast increase or decrease of new cases during a period.

200,202,Lymphatic Filariasis,booklet6,20
201,203,"Background﷐Lymphatic filariasis is the second leading cause of permanent and long-term disability worldwide. It affects over 120 million persons in 80 countries, and over 40 million persons are seriously incapacitated by the disease; 20% of the world population is at risk of infection. Of those infected, roughly 1/3 are in India, 1/3 in Africa, and the rest in the Americas, Asia, and the Pacific. In 1997, resolution WHA50.29 called for the elimination of lymphatic filariasis as a global public health problem. The strategy adopted is based on: Reducing transmission below a threshold where new infection ceases to occur Treatment of the problems associated with disability control and prevention. Causal agents:in Africa only the filariae Wuchereria bancrofti, Brugia malayi, and Brugia timori Modes of transmission: transmitted by various species of mosquitoes, these parasitic filarial worms lodge in the human lymphatic system, producing millions of immature microfilariae that circulate in the blood. Microfilariae appear in the peripheral blood after 3 to 6 months for Brugia malayi, 6 to 12 months for W bancrofti, often with nocturnal periodicity. When a mosquito thereafter bites the infected person, the microfilariae are picked up and the infection may be transmitted to others after about 2 weeks. Clinical description: Filarial infection may be clinically asymptomatic (even in the presence of laboratory evidence of lymphatic and kidney damage); the disease may also present as one or more acute manifestations (fever, local swellings, tropical pulmonary eosinophilia syndrome, lymphangitis). Chronic complications include: Lymphoedema or elephantiasis of the limbs Damage to the genital organs (including hydrocoele in men) Damage to the kidney (including chyluria) and lymphatic system.﷐Surveillance goal﷐There are currently 3 options and the choice will depend on the local situation: Routine monthly reporting of aggregated data on probable and confirmed cases from periphery to intermediate level and to central level Sentinel population surveys (standardized and periodical), Active case-finding through surveys of selected groups or through mass surveys. International: Annual reporting from central level to WHO (for a limited number of countries).  ﷐Standard case definition﷐Suspected case: Resident of an endemic area with a clinical sign of hydrocoele or lymphoedema for which other causes of these findings have been excluded. Confirmed case: A person with positive laboratory diagnosis of microfilaremia in blood smear, filarial antigenaemia or positive ultrasound test.﷐Respond to alert threshold: Lymphatic Filariasis﷐Confirm community prevalence of infection by surveys﷐Respond to action threshold﷐Case management Hygiene measures for the affected body parts (and, when necessary, antibiotics and antifungal agents) can decrease the risk of adenolymphangitis: Washing the affected parts twice daily with soap and water Raising the affected limb at night Exercising to promote lymph flow Keeping nails short and clean Wearing comfortable footwear Using antiseptic or antibiotic creams to treat small wounds or abrasions, or in severe cases systemic antibiotics. For the treatment of filarial carriers, the regimen recommended by the country is to be followed: In areas where there is neither onchocerciasis nor loiasis: DEC 6 mg/kg single dose. In areas where Onchocerciasis has been excluded but not loiasis: individual clinical decision. The current strategy for filariasis control rests essentially on anti-parasitic measures. To interrupt transmission, the entire at risk population must be given a yearly, 1-dose regimen of the following: Areas with concurrent onchocerciasis: 400 mg of albendazole + ivermectin 150 mg per kg of body weight once a year for 4-6 years Areas with no concurrent Onchocerciasis Diethylcarbamazine 6 milligrams per kg of body weight + albendazole 400 mg once a year, or Diethylcarbamazine fortified salt for daily use for at least 6-12 months. NOTE: In areas with concurrent loiasis (sub-Saharan Africa rain forest), mass interventions cannot at present be envisaged systematically (unless Onchocerciasis is a severe public health problem), because of the risk of severe adverse reactions in patients with high-density Loa infections (about 1 in 10,000 treatments). It is important to educate the population on the importance of compliance during mass chemotherapy.  Special efforts for vector control are not required as regards Lymphatic Filariasis. They should be carried out under other existing vector control programmes such as anti-malaria vector control operations. ﷐Analyse and interpret data: Lymphatic Filariasis﷐Map the distribution of lymphatic filariasis and identify implementation units that will require mass drug administration Analyse the drug coverage in implementation units Assess the decline of parasitological indices microfilaremia before starting MDA and after at least four rounds of MDA till the criteria of less than 1% microfilaraemia in the population and less than 0.1% antigenaemia in school entry children is achieved﷐Diagnostic test﷐Night blood smear Filarial antigen test﷐Specimen﷐Blood smear Blood﷐When to collect﷐Night between 10pm and 2am Any time of the day﷐How to prepare, store, and transport﷐Spread three drops of blood on a glass slide and spread across the slide to make three lines.

203,205,Malaria,booklet6,7
204,206,"Background﷐Malaria is an endemic tropical illness with fever following the bite of an infected female Anopheles mosquito which transmits the parasite. Five parasite species cause malaria in humans, namely: Plasmodium falciparum (the most common), P. ovale, P. vivax, P. malariae and P. knowlesi. Serious malarial infections are usually due to P. falciparum which may result in severe disease.  Malaria is one of the leading causes of illness and death in many African countries. In most parts of Africa malaria transmission is highly seasonal. In areas of high transmission in Africa malaria is mainly a disease of children less than 5 years old and pregnant women. However, some countries have witnessed a dramatic reduction of malaria transmission and in such countries malaria has become a disease of all age groups and malaria epidemics are likely to occur.  The incubation period from the time of being bitten to onset of symptoms is approximately 10 to 14 days. The incubation period may be longer, with non- P. falciparum species. ﷐Surveillance goal﷐Detect malaria cases promptly in areas of high transmission and to detect epidemics promptly in epidemic prone areas or in areas with a large population at risk.﷐Standard case definition: Malaria﷐Uncomplicated malaria: Uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria is highly variable and mimics that of many other diseases. Although fever is common, it is often intermittent and may even be absent in some cases. The fever is typically irregular initially and commonly associated with chills. Rigors are unusual in acute falciparum malaria. The patient commonly complains of fever, headache, aches and pains elsewhere in the body and occasionally abdominal pain and diarrhoea. In a young child, there may be irritability, refusal to eat and vomiting. On physical examination, fever may be the only sign. In some patients, the liver and spleen are palpable. This clinical presentation is usually indistinguishable clinically from those of influenza and a variety of other common causes of fever. Unless the condition is diagnosed and treated promptly, a patient with falciparum malaria may deteriorate rapidly. Therefore, any person living in an area at risk of malaria with fever or history of fever within the previous 24 hours; without signs of severe malaria, who tests positive for malaria by either rapid diagnostic test or microscopy should be considered a case of uncomplicated malaria (NB WHO presently recommends that all malaria cases should be confirmed by RDT or microscopy).  Severe malaria: Severe malaria is defined by clinical or laboratory evidence of vital organ dysfunction. Nearly all deaths from severe malaria result from infections with P. falciparum. Strict definitions of severe malaria have been published for epidemiological and research purposes, but, in practice, there should be a low threshold for starting parenteral treatment in any patient about whom a health care worker is concerned. Even if some of the laboratory measures are not available immediately, this should not delay the start of intensive treatment. A general overview of the features of severe malaria include:  impaired consciousness (including unarousable coma); prostration, i.e. generalized weakness so that the patient is unable to sit, stand or walk without assistance; multiple convulsions: more than two episodes within 24h; deep breathing and respiratory distress (acidotic breathing); acute pulmonary oedema and acute respiratory distress syndrome; circulatory collapse or shock, systolic blood pressure < 80mm Hg in adults and < 50mm Hg in children; acute kidney injury;  clinical jaundice plus evidence of other vital organ dysfunction; and abnormal bleeding Note: These manifestations can occur singly or, more commonly, in combination in the same patient.  Any patient hospitalized with P. falciparum asexual parasitaemia as confirmed by laboratory tests with accompanying symptoms and signs of severe disease (vital organ dysfunction) diagnosed through laboratory.﷐Respond to alert threshold: Malaria﷐If there is an unusual increase in the number of malaria cases or deaths as compared to the same period in previous non-epidemic years: Report suspected epidemic to the next level, Treat with appropriate anti-malarial drugs according to national treatment guidelines Investigate the cause for the increase in cases Make sure cases in children age 2 months up to 5 years are managed according to IMCI guidelines. Conduct community education for prompt detection of cases and access to health facilities.﷐Respond to action threshold﷐If the number of cases exceeds the upper limit of cases seen in a previous non-epidemic period in previous years: Evaluate and improve, as needed, prevention strategies, such as use of insecticide treated nets (ITNs) and indoor residential spraying (IRS) for all at risk of malaria. Ensure appropriate case management Ensure adequate supplies and drugs are available in the health facilities﷐Analyse and interpret data﷐Time: Graph the number of cases by month/week.

207,209,"In areas with endemic malaria, the national Malaria Control Program can assist districts and health centres with determining appropriate thresholds for detecting possible epidemics. In the absence of a threshold set by the national program, the following method can be used to determine the threshold level for a malaria epidemic. The threshold is determined using the median and the 3rd quartile of a period of time (for example, 5-year data from a health facility or district by month/week):",booklet6,493

210,212,Determine the 3rd quartile for the monthly/weekly series by identifying the 4th highest number from the bottom in each data series (since data is ranked in ascending order). This is the 3rd quartile representing the upper limit of the expected normal number of malaria cases.,booklet6,275

218,220,"Background﷐Globally, maternal and child under-nutrition are underlying causes for 3·5 million deaths, including 35% of the disease burden in children younger than 5 years. Of the 40 countries with a child stunting prevalence of 40% or more, 23 are in Africa. Severe malnutrition may act as a direct cause of death or an indirect cause by increasing dramatically the number of deaths in children suffering from common childhood illnesses such as diarrhoea and pneumonia. Despite the above, the burden of child mortality due to severe malnutrition remains largely absent from the international health agenda and few countries, even in high prevalence areas, have specific national policies aimed at addressing it comprehensively. The most vulnerable are children under five and pregnant and lactating women. The poor nutritional status and nutritional intake of pregnant women may contribute to newborns with low birth weight (a weight measured immediately after birth). A newborn weighing less than 2500 grams (2.5 kg or 5.5 Ib) is considered a newborn with low birth weight (LBW). LBW is a major determinant of death, illness and disability in infancy and childhood and also impacts health outcomes in adult life. Socio-economic conditions, poor water and sanitation, mothers’ nutritional education on how to feed babies and young children, and repeated infections are the main causes of malnutrition. Programmes elaborated to eradicate malnutrition are on food security, water and sanitation, promotion of infant and young children feeding practices, micronutrient supplementation programmes, management of severe cases of malnutrition in the communities and in the health facilities, management of infections mainly diarrhoeal disease. Many sporadic surveys are being organized, but nutrition surveillance is currently poorly implemented and does not allow for interventions related to prevention and management of malnutrition.﷐Surveillance goal﷐Early warning and problem identification. Policy-making and planning. Programme management and evaluation. Assess effectiveness of public health response that address causes of low birth weight, malnutrition in children and malnutrition in pregnant women",booklet6,2203

222,224,"Background﷐Deaths of women during pregnancy, childbirth or termination of pregnancy, and deaths up to 6 weeks (42 days) after childbirth or termination of pregnancy related to pregnancy are considered Maternal Deaths. (NB. Those due to accidental or incidental causes are not considered as maternal deaths) Globally, about 80% of maternal deaths are due to; severe bleeding (mostly bleeding postpartum), infections (also mostly soon after delivery), hypertensive disorders in pregnancy (eclampsia) and obstructed labor. Complications after unsafe abortion cause 13% of maternal deaths.   Across the developing world, maternal mortality levels remain too high, with more than 500,000 women dying every year as a result of complications during pregnancy and childbirth. About half of these deaths occur in sub-Saharan Africa where a woman’s lifetime risk of maternal death is 1 in 22, compared with 1 in 8,000 in industrialized countries.  Haemorrhage is the leading cause of maternal death in sub-Saharan Africa, and unattended births are a particular risk, especially in rural areas where transport to health care facilities is a problem. Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) reporting in 2030 demands active surveillance, and counting of maternal deaths.

223,225,Measles,booklet6,7
224,226,"Background﷐Measles is a febrile rash illness due to paramyxovirus (Morbillivirus) transmitted human-to-human via airborne droplet spread. It is the fourth leading cause of death in children less than 5 years of age in many African countries. The incubation period is 7 to 18 days from exposure to onset of fever. Among children with vitamin A deficiency and malnutrition, measles may result in severe illness due to the virus itself and associated bacterial infections, especially pneumonia; only the minority of cases are severe. Measles is among the most transmissible of human infections. Large outbreaks occur every few years in areas with low vaccine coverage and where there is an accumulation of persons who have never been infected or vaccinated. The true incidence of measles far exceeds reported cases. Risk factors include low vaccine coverage (<85 to 90%) which allows accumulation of susceptible persons at high risk for measles. Outbreaks can be explosive in areas of high population density. Other viral illnesses such as rubella may cause or contribute to similar outbreaks.﷐Surveillance goal﷐Detect outbreaks of fever with rash illness promptly: In the African Region of the WHO, in line with the Regional measles elimination goal: immediate case-based reporting of suspected cases and deaths of fever with rash illness; confirm all suspected measles cases with laboratory test (serum IgM). ﷐Standard case definition﷐Suspected case: Any person with fever and maculopapular (non-vesicular) generalized rash and cough, coryza or conjunctivitis (red eyes) or any person in whom a clinician suspects measles. Confirmed case: A suspected case with laboratory confirmation (positive IgM antibody) or epidemiological link to confirmed cases in an outbreak.﷐Respond to alert threshold﷐Measles alert threshold in Malawi is reached when either a minimum of 5 suspected cases or one confirmed case are reported from a health facility. If an outbreak is suspected: Report suspected case to the next level. Collect blood sample for confirming the outbreak. Treat cases with oral rehydration, vitamin A, and antibiotics for prevention of bacterial super-infection.

Collect into a test tube, capillary tube or microtainer. Separate blood cells from serum. Let clot retract for 30 to 60 minutes at room temperature. Centrifuge at 2000 rpm for 10-20 minutes and pour off serum into a clean glass tube. If no centrifuge, put sample in refrigerator overnight (4 to 6 hours) until clot retracts. Pour off serum the next morning. If no centrifuge and no refrigerator, let blood sit at an angle for at least 60 minutes (without shaking or being driven in a vehicle). Pour off serum into a clean tube. Store serum at 4°C. Transport serum samples using appropriate packaging to prevent breaking or leaks during transport. ﷐Results: The specimen should arrive at the laboratory within 3 days of being collected. Results are usually available after 7 days. If as few as 2 out of 5 suspected measles cases are laboratory confirmed, the outbreak is confirmed. Avoid shaking of specimen before serum has been collected. To prevent bacterial overgrowth, ensure that the serum is poured into a clean glass test tube. The test tube does not need to be sterile, just clean. Transport the serum in an EPI hand vaccine carrier to 4ºC to 8ºC to prevent bacterial overgrowth (up to 7 days). If not refrigerated, serum stored in a clean tube will be good for at least 3 days.﷐Reference﷐“Response to measles outbreaks in measles mortality reduction settings” http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/70047/1/WHO_IVB_09.03_eng.pdf  WHO–recommended standards for surveillance of selected vaccine-preventable diseases (2018). http://www.who.int/immunization/monitoring_surveillance/burden/vpd/WHO_SurveillanceVaccinePreventable_11_Measles_R1.pdf?ua=1  World Health Organization.

225,227,Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS),booklet6,39
226,228,"Background﷐﷐﷐﷐﷐﷐Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) is a viral respiratory disease caused by a novel coronavirus (Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, or MERS‐CoV) that was first identified in Saudi Arabia in 2012. Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that can cause diseases ranging from the common cold to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and death. Typical MERS symptoms include fever, cough and shortness of breath. Pneumonia is common, but not always present. Gastrointestinal symptoms, including diarrhoea, have also been reported. Some laboratory-confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection are reported as asymptomatic, meaning that they do not have any clinical symptoms, yet they are positive for MERS following a laboratory test. Most of these asymptomatic cases have been detected following aggressive contact tracing of a laboratory-confirmed case. Approximately 35% of reported patients with MERS have died. Dromedary camels are the major reservoir host for MERS-CoV and humans are infected from direct or indirect unprotected contact with infected dromedary camels. However, the exact role of dromedaries in transmission of the virus and the exact route(s) of transmission are unknown. The virus does not seem to pass easily from person to person unless there is close unprotected contact, such as occurs when providing care to a patient. Health care associated outbreaks have occurred in several countries, with the largest outbreaks seen in Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, and the Republic of Korea.  Approximately half of human cases of MERS have been attributed to human-to-human infections in health care settings. ﷐﷐﷐﷐﷐﷐Surveillance Goal﷐﷐﷐﷐﷐﷐To detect early cases of MERS-CoV infection and any evidence of sustained human-to-human transmission To determine the geographic risk areas for infection with the virus﷐﷐﷐﷐﷐﷐Standard case definition﷐﷐﷐﷐﷐﷐http://www.who.int/csr/disease/coronavirus_infections/technical-guidance-surveillance/en/ The following people should be investigated and tested for MERS-CoV (From: Surveillance for human infection with Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS - CoV) A person with an acute respiratory infection, with history of fever and cough and indications of pulmonary parenchymal disease (e.g. pneumonia or ARDS), based on clinical or radiological evidence, who requires admission to hospital, with no other aetiology that fully explains the clinical presentation (clinicians should also be alert to the possibility of atypical presentations in patients who are immunocompromised); AND any of the following: the person resides in the Middle East, in particular where human infections have been reported, and in countries where MERS-CoV is known to be circulating in dromedary camels; the patient is part of a cluster of acute respiratory illness that occurs within a 14 day period, without regard to place of residence or history of travel; the disease occurs in a health care worker who has been working in an environment where patients with severe acute respiratory infections are being cared for, without regard to place of residence or history of travel; the person develops an unusual or unexpected clinical course, especially sudden deterioration despite appropriate treatment, without regard to place of residence or history of travel, even if another aetiology has been identified that fully explains the clinical presentation. A person with an acute respiratory infection, with history of fever and cough and indications of pulmonary parenchymal disease (e.g. pneumonia or ARDS), based on clinical or radiological evidence, and who has travelled within 14 days before onset of illness to the Middle East2 or countries where MERS-CoV is known to be circulating in dromedary camels or where human infections have recently occurred. Individuals with acute respiratory illness of any degree of severity who, within 14 days before onset of illness, had any of the following exposures (Note: see section on Recommendations for testing in clusters associated with health care settings):  close physical contact with a confirmed or probable case of MERS-CoV infection, while that patient was ill; a healthcare facility in a country where hospital-associated MERS-CoV infections have been reported; direct contact with dromedary camels or consumption or exposure to dromedary camel products (raw meat, unpasteurized milk, urine) in countries where MERS-CoV is known to be circulating in dromedary camel populations or where human infections occurred as a result of presumed zoonotic transmission. Countries in the Middle East2 are also strongly encouraged to consider adding testing for MERS-CoV to current testing algorithms as part of routine sentinel respiratory disease surveillance and diagnostic panels for pneumonia.  WHO case definitions for MERS-CoV can be found here http://www.who.int/entity/csr/disease/coronavirus_infections/case_definition/en/index.html Confirmed case definition A person with laboratory confirmation of MERS-CoV infection,1 irrespective of clinical signs and symptoms. Probable case definition A febrile acute respiratory illness with clinical, radiological, or histopathological evidence of pulmonary parenchymal disease (e.g. pneumonia or Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome) ANDDirect epidemiologic link2 with a laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV case ANDTesting for MERS-CoV is unavailable, negative on a single inadequate specimen3 or inconclusive4  A febrile acute respiratory illness with clinical, radiological, or histopathological evidence of pulmonary parenchymal disease (e.g. pneumonia or Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome) that cannot be explained fully by any other aetiologyANDThe person resides or travelled in the Middle East, or in countries where MERS-CoV is known to be circulating in dromedary camels or where human infections have recently occurred ANDTesting for MERS-CoV is inconclusive4  An acute febrile respiratory illness of any severity ANDDirect epidemiologic link2 with a confirmed MERS-CoV case ANDTesting for MERS-CoV is inconclusive4  Notes 1 A case may be laboratory confirmed by detection of viral nucleic acid or serology. The presence of viral nucleic acid can be confirmed by either positive results for nucleic acid amplification assays, such as reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), for at least two specific genomic targets or a single positive target with sequencing of a second target. A case confirmed by serology requires demonstration of sero-conversion in 2 samples ideally taken at least 14 days apart, by a screening (ELISA, IFA) and a neutralization assay. However, the interim recommendations for laboratory testing for MERS-CoV should be consulted for the most recent standard for laboratory confirmation (http://www.who.int/csr/disease/coronavirus_infections/en/) 2 A direct epidemiological link with a confirmed MERS-CoV patient may include: Health care associated exposure, including providing direct care for MERS-CoV patients, working with health care workers infected with MERS-CoV, visiting patients or staying in the same close environment of a individuals infected with MERS-CoV.  Working together in close proximity or sharing the same environment with individuals infected with MERS-CoV.  Traveling together with individuals infected with MERS-CoV in any kind of conveyance  Living in the same household as individuals infected with MERS-CoV.  The epidemiological link may have occurred within a 14-day period before or after the onset of illness in the case under consideration.  3 An inadequate specimen would include a nasopharyngeal swab without an accompanying lower respiratory specimen, a specimen that has had improper handling, is judged to be of poor quality by the testing laboratory, or was taken too late in the course of illness. 4 Inconclusive tests may include:  A positive test by nucleic acid amplification assay for a single target without further  testing. Evidence of sero-reactivity by a single convalescent serum sample ideally taken at least 14 days after exposure by a screening assay (ELISA or IFA) and a neutralization assay, in the absence of molecular confirmation from respiratory specimens.  Inconclusive testing: Patients with an inconclusive initial testing should undergo additional virologic and serologic testing to determine if the patient can be classified as a confirmed MERS case. It is strongly advised that multiple lower respiratory tract specimens such as sputum, endotracheal aspirate, or bronchoalveolar lavage fluid be collected and tested when possible. If patients do not have signs or symptoms of lower respiratory tract disease and lower tract specimens are not available or clinically indicated, both nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swab specimens should be collected. If initial testing of a nasopharyngeal swab is negative in a patient who is strongly suspected to have MERS-CoV infection, patients should be retested using a lower respiratory specimen tract or a repeat nasopharyngeal specimen with additional oropharyngeal specimen if lower respiratory tract specimens are not possible, and appropriately timed paired acute and convalescent sera. Other types of clinical specimens could also be considered for molecular testing if necessary, including blood/serum, urine and stool. These generally have lower titres of virus than respiratory tract specimens but have been used to confirm cases when other specimens were inadequate or unobtainable. Laboratories which obtain discordant PCR testing results and have limited experience in detecting MERS-CoV should consider referring their specimens to laboratories with greater experience for confirmation.﷐﷐﷐﷐﷐﷐Refer to the WHO case reporting form (available in English and French) Responding to an alert ﷐﷐﷐﷐﷐﷐If a single case/cluster or outbreak is suspected: All health care workers who collect specimens from patients suspected or confirmed with MERS-CoV must wear appropriate personal protective equipment, and Standard and droplet infection control precautions are sufficient when collecting biological samples from suspected patients. Additional precautions are required when aerosol-generating procedures are performed on a patient All those involved in collection and transporting specimens should be trained in safe handling practices and spill decontamination procedures. WHO requests that probable and confirmed cases be reported within 24 hours of classification, through the regional contact point for International Health Regulations at the appropriate WHO regional office.  ﷐﷐﷐﷐﷐﷐Proper and respectful burial or cremation (if practiced) of dead bodies (humans) Conduct community education about the confirmed case, how the disease is transmitted, and how to use infection control in the home care setting (see http://www.who.int/csr/disease/coronavirus_infections/technical-guidance-infection/en/) Efforts to identify additional cases beyond close contacts are critical for prevention and control of infection, and to determine the total extent of transmission in the community. Active case finding in the area under investigation should focus on: Patients currently admitted to health care facilities in the community where the confirmed MERS-CoV case was discovered. Any patients currently in the hospital with unexplained SARI should be considered for testing for MERS-CoV. Health care providers in the community; health workers should be interviewed about recent cases of unexplained pneumonia and notified to immediately report any patients who have signs and symptoms that meet the case definition developed for the investigation as described above in section 3.4.1. Patients meeting the case definition should be tested for MERS-CoV. Patients who recently died of an unexplained illness consistent with the case definition developed for the investigation should be tested for MERS-CoV infection if appropriate clinical specimens are available. Close contacts of confirmed or probable cases should be identified and monitored for the appearance of respiratory symptoms for 14 days after last exposure to the confirmed or suspected case, while the case was symptomatic. Any contact that becomes ill in that period of time should be tested for MERS-CoV.  If feasible, all contacts especially health care workers and other inpatient hospital contacts, regardless of the development of symptoms should be tested for MERS-CoV. Request additional help from national levels, as needed.﷐﷐﷐﷐﷐﷐Analyse and interpret data﷐﷐﷐﷐﷐﷐Time: Graphs of number of suspected / probable / confirmed cases by date (epidemic curve). Place: Map of suspected and confirmed human and animal cases by geographical area (district) Person: Table showing the number of suspected / probable / confirmed cases by date, age and sex﷐﷐﷐﷐﷐﷐Laboratory confirmation﷐﷐﷐﷐﷐﷐In this section guidelines on laboratory confirmation are provided including: relevant diagnostic tests, how to collect, store and transport the specimens needed for lab confirmation, and information on the results of laboratory work. Laboratory guidance for MERS-CoV http://www.who.int/entity/csr/disease/coronavirus_infections/technical-guidance-laboratory/en/index.html Recommendations for specimen collection Lower respiratory specimens have a higher diagnostic value than upper respiratory tract specimens for detecting MERS-CoV infection. Upper respiratory tract samples have yielded negative results in some symptomatic close contacts of confirmed cases, who later developed pneumonia and tested positive on lower respiratory specimens. It is WHO has strongly advised that lower respiratory specimens such as sputum, endotracheal aspirate, or bronchoalveolar lavage be collected for MERS-CoV testing where possible. If patients do not have signs or symptoms of lower respiratory tract disease and the collection of lower tract specimens is not possible or clinically indicated, upper respiratory tract specimens such as a nasopharyngeal aspirate or combined nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs should be collected.  If initial testing is negative in a patient who is strongly suspected to have MERS-CoV infection, the patient should be resampled and specimens collected from multiple respiratory tract sites. Paired acute and convalescent sera for antibody detection should also be collected. Virus has also been demonstrated in body fluids such as blood, urine, and stool, but usually at lower titres than in respiratory tract specimens. Such specimens may be collected when good quality respiratory tract specimens are unavailable, or to monitor the presence of virus in different body compartments. Table 1.

227,229,MonkeyPox,booklet6,9
228,230,"Background﷐Monkeypox is a rare, viral, zoonotic orthopoxvirus disease that has a similar but milder disease presentation as (now eradicated) smallpox in humans. It is usually a self-limiting disease but the case-fatality rate can be up to 10%, particularly among children. Monkeypox primarily occurs in the rain forests in West and Central Africa. The primary animal reservoir is unknown but it has been detected in a range of small mammal species, particularly rodents, and monkeys. Animal species in which evidence of monkeypox virus has been found include C. gambianus (Gambian pouched rat), different squirrel species of the genus Funisciurus and Heliosciurus, G. kelleni (African dormice) and various species of non-human primates.  Communities living in the West and Central African rainforest regions need to be educated about avoiding direct contact with animals, especially wild species. Efforts to prevent transmission in endemic regions should focus on thoroughly cooking all animal products (blood, meat) before eating. Human-to-human transmission is limited (no evidence that this mode of transmission alone can sustain monkeypox in human populations) and occurs via prolonged contact with respiratory droplets and contact with lesions or bodily fluids that contain the virus. Household members and health care workers are at highest risk during an outbreak. Monkeypox is an emerging disease which has become the most prevalent orthopoxvirus since the global eradication of smallpox that was declared by the World Health Assembly in 1980. This is partly because smallpox vaccination which was cross-protective for other orthopoxviruses was discontinued at the time which means younger people no longer have vaccine-induced immunity. Human monkeypox was first identified in humans in 1970 in the Democratic Republic of Congo which remains the country that routinely reports the highest number of cases (>1,000) annually since 2005. Other countries that have reported human cases since 1970 include Sierra Leone, Liberia, Cote d’Ivoire, Nigeria, Cameroon, Gabon, Republic of Congo, Central African Republic and Sudan (in an area that is now South Sudan). Since late 2016 there have been increasing reports of monkeypox cases from countries that have not seen any for the past 40 years. Clinical recognition, particularly differential diagnosis with other rash and fever illnesses such as chickenpox, laboratory-based diagnosis and prevention remain critical challenges in endemic areas. Two distinct clades or subtypes have been identified. It is believed that infection with a West African strain of monkeypox virus causes a less severe infection, fewer deaths, and lower rates of human-to-human transmission as compared to outbreaks involving Central African strains. The incubation period of monkeypox is 6-16 days (range 5–21). The infection can be divided into two periods: (1) invasion period (0-5 days) characterized by fever, intense headache, lymphadenopathy (swelling of the lymph node), back pain, myalgia (muscle ache) and an intense asthenia (lack of energy); and (2) skin eruption period (1-3 days after appearance of fever) where the various stages of the rash appears, often beginning on the face and then spreading elsewhere on the body. The most distinguishing symptom of monkeypox is lymphadenopathy. The face (in 95% of cases), and palms of the hands and soles of the feet (75%) are most affected by the rash. Evolution of the rash from maculo-papules (lesions with a flat bases) to vesicles (small fluid-filled blisters), pustules, followed by crusts occurs in approximately 10 days. Three weeks might be necessary before the complete disappearance of the crusts.  Varicella (chickenpox) is often confused with monkeypox but can be distinguished from monkeypox and smallpox by its much more superficial lesions, their presence more on the trunk than on the face and extremities, and by the development of successive crops of lesions in the same area. Fever and rash occur simultaneously in chickenpox and develop more rapidly; with death being a rare complication. Coinfection with both, varicella and monkeypox virus, has been reported. However the frequency of this phenomenon, relationship and impact between the viruses’ pathogenesis and epidemiology is not clear.﷐Surveillance goal﷐To detect and immediately respond to any suspected case of monkeypox.﷐Standard case definition﷐Suspected case: An acute illness with fever > 38.3 C (101 F), intense headache, lymphadenopathy, back pain, myalgia, and intense asthenia followed one to three days later by a progressively developing rash often beginning on the face (most dense) and then spreading elsewhere on the body, including soles of feet and palms of hand. Probable case: A case that meets the clinical case definition, is not laboratory confirmed, but has an epidemiological link to a confirmed or probable case. Confirmed case: A clinically compatible case that is laboratory confirmed. Differential diagnosis: Alternative causes of clinical symptoms that must be considered include other rash illnesses, such as, smallpox, chickenpox, measles, bacterial skin infections, scabies, syphilis, and medication-associated allergies.",booklet6,5218

236,238,New HIV/AIDS Cases,booklet6,18
237,239,"Background AIDS is an infection of human lymphocytes (types of white blood cells) and other organs. It is caused by a retrovirus, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Sexual intercourse, needle injections, transfusions, trans-placental or trans-vaginal routes, breast milk or other direct contact with infected human body fluids transmits the virus from human to human. Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) results in late-stage HIV infection and immuno-suppression, with reduced numbers and function to T-lymphocytes. Primary HIV-related organ involvement and a variety of opportunistic infections result in death unless the growth of the virus is stopped by drugs that can kill the virus (antiretroviral therapy). When HIV infection progresses to illness, the symptoms are usually due to the failure of the immune system to resist other infectious diseases called opportunistic infections (OI). These include tuberculosis, bacterial pneumonia or sepsis, oro-pharyngeal candidiasis, chronic diarrhoea, chronic skin infections, recurrent herpes zoster, and others. Close to twenty-six million Africans, close to one in ten adults between the ages of 15 and 49 years of age, are living with HIV/AIDS. The impact of the epidemic is already measurable in greatly increased adult and child morbidity and mortality. HIV/AIDS is now the leading cause of adult mortality in the African Region. Incubation period is approximately 1 to 3 months from the time of infection to the time that antibodies can be detected in a laboratory process. The time from HIV infection to the onset of AIDS is generally 7 to 9 years. Risk factors: populations at high risk of acquiring HIV are commercial sex workers with or without other sexually transmitted infections (STIs). Some STIs may increase HIV transmission. Others at risk include intravenous drug users (IDU), recipients of unscreened blood products and neonates born to HIV-infected mothers. Tuberculosis, visceral leishmaniasis, trypanosomiasis, and other subacute or chronic bacterial, parasitic, and viral infections may cause similar syndromes.﷐Surveillance goal﷐Monitor the impact of HIV/AIDS interventions in trends of incidence and prevalence of HIV infections, AIDS and STIs through sentinel sites, surveys and special studies (according to guidelines for second generation surveillance of HIV/AIDS). Estimate the burden of HIV/AIDS in the district using available information from HIV sentinel populations so that each new AIDS case is counted. Monitor local STI epidemiology as possible cofactor for HIV transmission. Monitor local opportunistic infection epidemiology, including TB Improve percentage of suspected HIV/AIDS cases confirmed via serology. Improve HIV/AIDS screening.﷐Standard case definition: New HIV/AIDS Cases﷐WHO/AFRO recommends that countries use either Bangui or Abidjan HIV/AIDS case definitions. A positive ELISA for confirming HIV and a rapid test for confirming the positive results are sufficient for an epidemiologic case definition for HIV infection.﷐Public health actions﷐Monitor local STI and opportunistic infections, including TB, as possible cofactor for HIV. Improve percentage of suspected HIV/AIDS cases confirmed via serology. Monitor use of condoms by commercial sex workers. Provide voluntary counselling and testing services at district and sub-district levels. Treatment of individual cases with antiretroviral therapy is not yet widely available in most African countries. Rapid diagnosis and treatment of AIDS-related opportunistic infection (OI) may prolong life expectancy but this has not been widely evaluated in developing countries. Promote condom use, especially among high-risk individuals. Treat STIs, especially syphilis, chancroid diseases, and other ulcerative processes. Mobilize non-paid blood donors and promote appropriate use of blood. Promote good infection control practices within health facilities in the district. Educate patients and their sexual partners to refrain from donating blood, tissues, semen or breast milk.﷐Analyse and interpret data﷐Time: Count new HIV/AIDS cases and report monthly. Analyse by number of cases confirmed with serology.

239,241,"Background﷐Noma (cancrum oris, stomatitis gangrenosa) is an opportunistic bacterial infection affecting children 1–4 years characterized by quickly spreading orofacial gangrene, evolving from a gingival inflammation. Noma results from complex interactions between risk factors such as poor sanitation, malnutrition, recurrent illnesses, and compromised immunity. Diseases that commonly precede noma include measles, malaria, severe diarrhea, and necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis. Noma occurs worldwide, but is most common in sub-Saharan Africa. In 1998, WHO estimated that worldwide 140 000 children contract noma each year, and 79% of them die from the disease and associated complications. In Africa the highest prevalence of Noma occurs in countries bordering the Sahara desert, where a recent report estimates an annual incidence of 25,000. However, Noma can occur wherever there is extreme poverty. Early detection and treatment with antibiotics is key to preventing severe disfigurement or death. In the acute stage, death can be prevented with high doses of penicillin; however disfigurement can only be treated with costly surgery. Prevention should focus on education and awareness of the disease, improved nutrition and household hygiene, promotion of exclusive breastfeeding in the first 3–6 months of life, access to prenatal care, and immunizations against common childhood diseases. Clinical features include soreness of the mouth, pronounced halitosis (bad smelling breath), fetid taste, tenderness of the lip or cheek, cervical lymphadenopathy, a foul-smelling purulent oral discharge, and a blue-black discoloration of the skin and swelling in the affected area. Health workers should recognize risk factors for Noma: Severe growth failure in first 6 months of life Evidence of malnutrition and poor dietary habits; Persistent diarrhea Oral ulcers in children from high risk areas Prominent bad smelling breath﷐Surveillance goal﷐Early detection and treatment of cases Identification of high risk communities and families Estimation of disease incidence and identification of risk factors﷐Standard case definition: Noma﷐Suspected new case: Any child with a mouth ulcer and other warning signs such as; malnutrition, poor hygiene, recent illness from; measles, persistent diarrhoea, or malaria should be regarded as a potential noma case. Confirmed new case: Any person with a gangrenous disease which starts as gingival ulceration and spreads rapidly through the tissues of the mouth and face, destroying the soft and hard tissues.﷐Recommended public health action: Noma﷐When a suspected case is detected: Treat the case with nationally recommended antibiotic Conduct health promotion activities in the community for: Awareness of Noma among the community and in the household Improved environmental sanitation and personal hygiene Separation of livestock from areas where humans live Exclusive breast feeding for the first 6 months of life Improved nutrition and food preparation techniques Increase vaccination coverage in the district Improve sources of drinking water in at-risk communities Train public health personnel on early recognition of oral lesions that can lead to Noma.﷐Analyse and interpret data﷐Time:Monitor number of cases detected in time for treatment and use of standardized treatment.

Onchocerciasis is the second leading infectious cause of blindness worldwide. It causes debilitating skin problems, leading to significant decreases in productivity in areas where it is endemic. Entire villages have relocated away from the fertile lands near rivers where black flies breed. Incubation period is years to decades since repeated infection is necessary for disease manifestations.

243,245,"Background﷐The Global Strategy for Women’s and Children’s and Adolescents’ Health with its three objectives of Survive, Thrive and Transform sets targets for the coming 15 years which Member States have agreed and committed to achieve. This includes reducing neonatal mortality to less than 12 deaths per 1,000 births and stillbirths to less than 12 per 1,000 total births, in line with the multi-stakeholders’ action plan “Every Newborn: an action plan to end preventable deaths” (ENAP), which encompasses two goals:  ending preventable newborn deaths and stillbirths.    Globally there are 2.7 million neonatal deaths annually, of these 1 million take place in the African Region. Three main causes of neonatal deaths make up about 80% of the deaths: birth asphyxia, prematurity and neonatal infections. Equally, there are about 2.6 million annual stillbirths globally, of which 98 percent occur in developing countries.  About half of all stillbirths occur in the intrapartum period, representing the greatest time of risk. Causes of stillbirths may be a consequence of maternal conditions and diseases like pre-eclampsia, obesity, diabetes, malaria, syphilis and HIV. There are however no available global estimates on causes of stillbirths.    The reduction of neonatal mortality reached 38% in the African Region during the MDG era. However, the reduction has been much slower than that of the under-5 mortality of 54%. Achieving the set SDG target for the reduction of both stillbirths and neonatal deaths will require up to a seven-fold reduction of the current neonatal and stillbirth mortality rates in the African Region. This will require addressing current challenges for the efficient delivery of high quality services for mothers and newborns, but also efforts of strengthening the health information systems to understand the real number of deaths and the causes of deaths.   One of the biggest challenge in addressing both stillbirths and neonatal deaths is lack of information on the correct numbers and causes of deaths.  Yet majority of the stillbirths and neonatal deaths can be prevented with clearly targeted quality interventions by appropriately skilled health workers. Addressing these gaps calls for investing birth and death registration through surveillance and response, linking with perinatal review and taking action.            ﷐Surveillance goal﷐The primary goal is to eliminate preventable stillbirths and neonatal deaths by:  Counting every stillbirths and neonatal death through an active identification and reporting at community and facility levels to permit an assessment of the true magnitude of stillbirths and neonatal mortality and the impact of actions to reduce them; Identifying underlying causes, contributing factors and high risk areas for stillbirths and neonatal deaths to effectively guides immediate as well as longer term actions and to inform program decisions to reduce these deaths  ",booklet6,2941

260,262,Rabies (Human),booklet6,14
261,263,"Background﷐Rabies is a zoonotic disease (a disease that is transmitted to humans from animals) that is caused by a virus. Rabies infects domestic and wild animals, and is spread to people through close contact with infected saliva (via bites or scratches). The rabies virus infects the central nervous system, causing disease in the brain and, eventually, death. Early symptoms in people include: fever, headache, and general weakness or discomfort. As the disease progresses,symptomsinclude;insomnia,anxiety,confusion,slightorpartialparalysis,excitable behaviour, hallucinations, increase in saliva, difficulty swallowing, and fear of water. In unvaccinated humans, rabies is almost always fatal if post-exposure prophylaxis is not administered before the onset of severe symptoms. Death usually occurs within days of the onset of neurological symptoms. Dogs are the main carrier of rabies in Africa and are responsible for most (approximately 97%) of the human rabies deaths worldwide. WHO estimates approximately 55,000 human deaths worldwide due to rabies each year; in Africa the annual death toll is 24,000. People most at risk of rabies live in rural areas, and children are at highest risk of dog rabies. About 30% to 60% of the victims of dog bites (the primary mode of virus transmission) are children less than 15 years of age. Children often play with animals and are less likely to report bites or scratches. Control of rabies in dog populations and access to human rabies post exposure prophylaxis can substantially reduce the burden of rabies in human populations Rapid and accurate laboratory diagnosis of rabies in humans and other animals is essential for timely administration of post-exposure prophylaxis. Within a few hours, a diagnostic laboratory can determine whether or not an animal is rabid and inform the responsible medical personnel.﷐Surveillance goal﷐Detect and respond promptly and appropriately to cases and outbreaks of rabies. Identify high-risk areas Estimation of disease burden Immediate reporting of cases and routine monthly summary reports﷐Standard case definition﷐Suspected A person with one or more of the following: headache, neck pain, nausea, fever, fear of water, anxiety, agitation, abnormal tingling sensations or pain at the wound site, when contact with a rabid animal is suspected. Confirmed A suspected case that is laboratory confirmed﷐Recommended Public Health Action: Rabies (Human)﷐For a single case: Post exposure prophylaxis to prevent rabies Isolate patient if rabies develops to prevent infection of others Immunize contacts if patient develops rabies Vaccinate local dogs and cats to prevent outbreaks General preventive measures: Promote public awareness of rabies Target immunization campaign for domestic or wild animals in high-risk areas Maintain active surveillance of rabies in animals﷐Analyse and interpret data﷐Time:Plot cases monthly. Place:Plot the location of case households and animal exposures. Person:Analyse distribution of cases by age, exposing animal, and circumstances of infection.

No test can determine whether the rabies virus has been transmitted to the person immediately after the bite. So, the animal is evaluated to determine whether the person requires treatment.

At this point, tests can detect the rabies virus. Post mortem: within 4-6hrs after death of patient, as soon as the suspected animal dies or is killed﷐How to prepare, store, and transport the specimen﷐Safety precautions in handling rabies virus should be taken to avoid infection. Remove the head of the suspected animal, wrap head completely such that no blood is oozing out.

262,264,Rift Valley Fever (RVF),booklet6,23
263,265,"Background﷐Rift Valley Fever (RVF) is a viral disease that affects mainly animals and occasionally humans. The virus is a member of the Phlebovirus genus, one of the five genera in the family Bunyaviridae. The disease is frequently reported following heavy rainfall and floods. It was first isolated in Rift Valley Province of Kenya in 1930. The disease was reported in Kenya after the El Nino flooding of 1997/98 and more recently in 2006 to 2007. In 2007 and 2010, Tanzania and South Africa respectively were also affected. Other outbreaks have previously been reported in Somalia, Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Yemen. RVF is mainly transmitted from animals (sheep, cattle, goats, camels) to humans through close contact with infected animals (such as handling meat and body fluids and consumption of raw milk). During established RVF outbreaks in animals, humans can also get infected through bites of infected mosquitoes and other biting insects. The incubation period of RVF varies from 2 to 6 days. The clinical symptoms include an influenza-like illness, with sudden onset of fever, headache, myalgia and backache. These symptoms usually last from 4 to 7 days. Most of the infected people recover on their own. However, a small proportion (about 1%) get complications such as vomiting blood, nose bleeding and passing bloody stool. Other severe types of the disease are eye disease and meningo-encephalitis. Because the symptoms of Rift Valley fever are varied and non-specific, clinical diagnosis is often difficult, especially early in the course of the disease. Rift Valley fever is difficult to distinguish from other viral haemorrhagic fevers as well as many other diseases that cause fever, including malaria, shigellosis, typhoid fever, and yellow fever.  Management of RVF in humans is mainly supportive as there is no definitive treatment for RVF. Early detection and management of the disease is important. Human control of RVF is through control of the disease in animals through a sustained vaccination program and limiting human-animal contact. Use of insecticide treated nets and mosquito repellents can also reduce infections in human. In addition to human suffering and death, RVF has far reaching economic implications to the Livestock industry. In outbreak settings, the disease manifestation includes non-haemorrhagic febrile syndromes, and laboratory testing should be considered among persons with milder symptoms suggestive of viral illness. Immediate Notification to WHO is formally required by IHR (Annex 2A)",booklet6,2533

266,268,Severe Acute Respiratory Infections (SARIs),booklet6,43
267,269,"Background﷐Severe acute respiratory infections (SARIs) are a significant cause of infectious disease morbidity and mortality worldwide. It is estimated, as of December 2017, that annually 290 000 to 650 000 deaths are associated with seasonal influenza. The mortality rates are particularly high among vulnerable population such as children, elderly, chronically ill patients etc. An improved understanding of the epidemiology and seasonality of SARIs in Africa is essential for optimizing public health strategies for their prevention and control (e.g., vaccines and antivirals for prophylaxis and treatment, infection control). The threat of SARIs due to novel organisms that have epidemic or pandemic potential warrants special precautions and preparedness. Respiratory disease events that may constitute a public health emergency of international concern1 include human influenza caused by a new subtype, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), pneumonic plague, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), and novel agents that can cause large-scale SARI outbreaks with high morbidity and mortality.﷐Surveillance goals﷐To detect, in a timely manner, unusually severe morbidity and mortality caused by both known and unknown respiratory pathogens that have the potential for large-scale epidemics or pandemics. To characterize and monitor trends in illnesses and deaths attributable to SARIs.﷐Standard case definition﷐An acute respiratory infection with: history of fever or measured fever of ≥ 38 C°; and cough; with onset within the last 10 days; and requires hospitalization.﷐Respond to an alert threshold﷐Please refer to the WHO protocol to investigate non-seasonal influenza and other emerging acute respiratory diseases, 2018, if there is an unusual event (clusters of acute respiratory infections or of atypical respiratory infections, a cluster of deaths, for example) of respiratory infection. ﷐Respond to an action threshold﷐Please refer to the WHO protocol to investigate non-seasonal influenza and other emerging acute respiratory diseases, 2018, if a single case of pandemic-prone acute respiratory disease is suspected.﷐Analyse and interpret data﷐Time: Frequency of reporting: Epidemiological and virological data collected from the sentinel sites should be analysed on a weekly basis. Graph cases and deaths weekly. Construct an epidemic curve throughout the year and describe transmission patterns and changes in the level of respiratory activity compared to the previous week(s), year(s)  Place: Cases should be mapped by geographical location; for example, by village, by home or by location in a health-care facility. Describe possible exposures. Person: For individual SARI patients tested for influenza viruses, the minimum data to be collected and analysed for each patient, especially if a specimen is collected, is : Unique identifier (to link laboratory and epidemiological data, and for tracking patient if necessary), Sex, Age, History of fever and body temperature at presentation, Date of symptom onset, Date of hospitalization (SARI patients only), Patient outcome (death, survival), Date of specimen collection, Antiviral use for present illness at the time of specimen collection, Pregnancy status., Presence of chronic pre-existing medical illness(es) (Chronic respiratory disease, Asthma, Diabetes, Chronic cardiac disease, Chronic neurological or neuromuscular disease, Haematological disorders, HIV). Data on SARI can be aggregated by age groups to facilitate analysis and reporting. Recommended major age groupings for analysing are: 0 to <2 years, 2 to <5 years, 5 to <15 years, 15 to <50 years, 50 to <65 years, ≥ 65 years. For the laboratory data, as a minimum, it is recommended that the following data should be collected: • The number of samples tested for influenza during the week. • The proportion of samples that were positive for influenza for SARI  • Types and subtypes of viruses detected during the week. • Results from antiviral resistance testing (if applicable). At the end, the following indicators or aggregated data should be collected and reported from each sentinel site: The number of new SARI cases from whom specimens were collected during the week, grouped by standard age groups, and the proportion of each of these that were positive for influenza. The total number of new SARI cases reported during the week, grouped by standard age groups (this includes cases that were not tested and/or did not have detailed data collected). The number of total new hospital admissions reported during the week in the sentinel hospital where SARI surveillance is being conducted, ideally grouped by the recommended age groups. The number of SARI deaths occurring in the healthcare facility sentinel site reported during the week, grouped by standard age groups. The proportion of cases having each of the chronic pre-existing medical illnesses for influenza  positive SARI cases, reported separately. Further technical information on the role of laboratory can be found in the  WHO Global Epidemiological Surveillance Standards for Influenza, 2014. https://www.who.int/influenza/resources/documents/influenza_surveillance_manual/en/ AFRGeneric protocol for influenza sentinel surveillance: https://afro.who.int/publications/protocol-national-influenza-sentinel-surveillance  ﷐Laboratory testing: Severe Acute Respiratory Infections (SARIs)﷐ 1- For the influenza virus: Specimens can be positive seven days or more after the onset of illness but ability to detect virus drops off notably after five to seven days, depending on the test used. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is the most sensitive method for detecting influenza virus and is the recommended influenza surveillance assay for most laboratories. Virus culture is also needed on at least a subset of specimens in order to allow detailed antigenic and genetic characterization of the virus. Antiviral resistance testing should be considered for high-risk patients if capacity exists in the laboratory in addition to taking a sample from non-high-risk patients Further technical information on the role of laboratory can be found in the  WHO Global Epidemiological Surveillance Standards for Influenza, 2014. https://www.who.int/influenza/resources/documents/influenza_surveillance_manual/en/ WHO Manual for the laboratory diagnosis and virological surveillance of influenza, 2011. https://www.who.int/influenza/gisrs_laboratory/manual_diagnosis_surveillance_influenza/en/  2- For others virus, and pathogens,please consult pathogens specific WHO guidances﷐References﷐WHO Global Epidemiological Surveillance Standards for Influenza, 2014.  AFR generic protocol for influenza sentinel surveillance 2015 https://afro.who.int/publications/protocol-national-influenza-sentinel-surveillance  Protocol for the investigation of acute respiratory illness outbreaks of unknown aetiology  https://afro.who.int/publications/protocol-investigation-acute-respiratory-illness-outbreaks-unknown-etiology WHO Fact Sheet on Seasonal Influenza, 2018 WHO protocol to investigate non-seasonal influenza and other emerging acute respiratory diseases, 2018 WHO Infection prevention and control of epidemic-and pandemic prone acute respiratory infections in health care guidelines, 2014 WHO Manual for the laboratory diagnosis and virological surveillance of influenza, 2011 WHO Operational guidance on sharing seasonal influenza viruses with WHO Collaborating Centres (CCs) under the Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System (GISRS)  WHO Operational guidance on sharing influenza viruses with human pandemic potential (IVPP) under the Pandemic Influenza Preparedness (PIP) Framework WHO Standard guidance for the clinical management of influenza infections, expected publication in 2019 Influenza WHO health topic page: (http://www.who.int/influenza/en/)",booklet6,7895

The most common causes of male and female genital ulcer are c) syphilis (Treponema pallidum), d) herpes simplex virus (HSV1 or 2) and e) chancroid (Haemophilus ducreyi). STIs are endemic in most countries of the world, including countries in Africa. Multiple simultaneous STIs are common (for example, gonorrhoea plus Chlamydia). STIs may be most highly prevalent in areas where HIV occurs and may facilitate HIV transmission. STIs may be primary or from repeated attacks of urethral discharge. STIs are a leading cause of abortion and stillbirth, prematurity, and congenital infections. They may lead to pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), a major cause of decreased fertility. Incubation periods for gonorrhoea are 2 to 7 days; Chlamydia 7 to 14 days (or longer); syphilis, 10 days to 12 weeks (usually around 3 weeks), and chancroid, 3 to 14 days. STIs may be more commonly diagnosed in men, in whom clinical evidence of infection may be more readily apparent.﷐Surveillance goal﷐Early detection and treatment of STI reduces transmission rates.

275,277,Smallpox (Variola),booklet6,18
276,278,"NOTE: Smallpox was eradicated worldwide in 1980 and there has been no disease in humans since 1977. Information in this section is provided to educate public health professionals to enable detection of re-emergence and to differentiate smallpox from similar diseases.﷐Background﷐Smallpox is an acute contagious disease caused by Variola virus, a member of the Orthopoxvirus genus, Poxviridae family. Other members of the genus that can cause disease in humans include Cowpox virus, Camelpox virus, and Monkeypox virus. Monkeypox virus has caused the most recent human poxvirus infections. Smallpox killed up to 30% of those infected and left survivors scarred and sometimes blind. In 1967, when WHO launched an intensified programme to eradicate smallpox, annually there were 10-15 million cases and 2 million deaths globally. The global eradication of smallpox was certified by a commission of eminent scientists in December 1979 and subsequently endorsed by the World Health Assembly in 1980. The incubation period of smallpox is 12–14 days (range 7–17) during which there is no evidence of viral shedding i.e. the person is not infectious. During this period, the person looks and feels healthy and cannot infect others. The disease presents as sudden onset of high fever and other symptoms such as malaise, headache, backache, nausea, vomiting. Two to three days later, the temperature falls and the patient feels somewhat better, at which time the characteristic rash appears, first on the face, hands and forearms and then after a few days progressing to the trunk. Lesions also develop in the mucous membranes of the nose and mouth, and ulcerate very soon after their formation, releasing large amounts of virus into the mouth and throat. The centrifugal distribution of lesions, more prominent on the face and extremities than on the trunk, is a distinctive diagnostic feature of smallpox and gives the trained eye cause to suspect the disease. Lesions progress from macules to papules to vesicles to pustules. All lesions in a given area progress together through these stages. From 8 to 14 days after the onset of symptoms, the pustules form scabs which leave depressed depigmented scars upon healing. Smallpox had two main forms: variola major and variola minor (the latter was less common). The disease followed a milder course in variola minor, which had a case-fatality rate of less than 1 per cent. The fatality rate of variola major was around 30%. There are two rare forms of severe smallpox: haemorrhagic and malignant. In the former, invariably fatal, the rash was accompanied by haemorrhage into the mucous membranes and the skin. Malignant smallpox was characterized by lesions that did not develop to the pustular stage but remained soft and flat. It was almost invariably fatal. Varicella (chickenpox) is often confused with smallpox and can be distinguished from smallpox by its much more superficial lesions, their presence more on the trunk than on the face and extremities, and by the development of successive crops of lesions in the same area. Fever and rash occur simultaneously in chickenpox and develop more rapidly; with death being a rare complication. Prior to the eradication of smallpox, human monkeypox virus infections were first reported in human populations in 1970 and may have been misdiagnosed as smallpox due to the similarity of cutaneous presentation and progression. The clinical features of smallpox and human monkeypox are similar; however, smallpox patients do not develop lymphadenopathy which is a prominent clinical sign of monkeypox.  The disease progression through the incubation period, pre-eruptive stage and rash are also similar between the two diseases. Human monkeypox is milder with a lower case fatality ratio (up to 10 %) compared to smallpox (up to 30 %). Smallpox is transmitted from person to person by infected aerosols and air droplets spread in direct and fairly prolonged face-to-face contact with an infected person after fever has begun, especially if symptoms include coughing. The disease can also be transmitted by contaminated clothes and bedding, though the risk of infection from this source is much lower. The most infectious period is when face-to-face contact occurs with a patient after fever has begun and during the first week of rash, when the virus is released via the respiratory tract. The most at-risk settings are households and health care settings with active cases but spread in the community is low because sick people are bedridden. In the absence of immunity induced by vaccination, humans appear to be universally susceptible to infection with the smallpox virus. Since vaccination with smallpox vaccine was discontinued globally after the eradication of smallpox in 1980, most of the world’s population under 40 years of age are not immune and the older age groups have waning immunity. WHO maintains smallpox vaccine emergency stockpiles to be deployed in the event of a smallpox re-emergence in order to contain the outbreak. First responders are prioritized to receive the vaccine. Vaccine administered up to 4 days after exposure to the virus, and before the rash appears, provides protective immunity and can prevent infection or ameliorate the severity of the disease. Immediate Notification of the occurrence of smallpox cases to WHO is formally required by IHR (2005). The risk of emergence of smallpox is extremely low as the remaining global live variola virus stocks are held in two high security laboratory facilities in Russia and the US and the disease has no animal reservoir.﷐Surveillance goal﷐To detect and immediately respond to a potential re-emergence or any suspected case of smallpox.",booklet6,5707

279,281,Trachoma,booklet6,8
280,282,"Background﷐Trachoma is the leading cause of preventable blindness worldwide. It is caused by infection with Chlamydia trachomatis bacteria, and is both treatable and preventable. Infections often begin during infancy or childhood and can become chronic. If left untreated, the infection eventually causes the eyelid to turn inwards, which in turn causes the eyelashes to rub on the eyeball, resulting in intense pain and scarring of the front of the eye. This ultimately leads to irreversible blindness, typically between 30 and 40 years of age. Trachoma is easily spread through direct personal contact, shared towels and cloths, and flies that have come in contact with the eyes or nose of an infected person. WHO estimates that approximately 6 million cases of blindness due to trachoma and 11 million cases of trichiasis occur worldwide each year. Prevalence of active disease in children varies from 10-40% in some African countries. The infection primarily affects young children, with blindness occurring later in life. Females are three times more likely than males to suffer from trichiasis, the in-turning of the eyelashes that can lead to blindness. People are most at risk for trachoma infection in areas where there is poor sanitation, lack of latrines, poor sources of clean water, and the presence of flies. Primary interventions advocated for preventing trachoma infection include improved sanitation, reduction of fly breeding sites and increased facial cleanliness (with clean water) among children at risk of disease. The scaring and visual change for trachoma can be reversed by a simple surgical procedure performed at village level which reverses the in-turned eyelashes.﷐Surveillance goal﷐Prevention of blindness by early detection Identification of high risk areas and epidemiologic trends Estimation of disease burden Monitoring of control programs﷐Standard case definition﷐Suspected case: Any patient with red sticky eyes who complains of pain and itchiness of the eyes. Confirmed case: Any patient with red sticky eyes who complains of pain and itchiness of the eyes where examination of the eyes confirms one of the stages of Trachoma infection according to the WHO Simplified Trachoma Grading System.

282,284,"Background﷐Trypanosomiasis is an infection of blood, lymphatics and central nervous system. In Africa it is caused by the protozoan Trypanosoma burcei rhodesiense and T. b. gambiense, which are transmitted by the bit of infected Glossina (tsetse) flies. Trypanosomiasis is endemic in over 30 African countries in West, Central and East Africa. It is highly epidemic in the Democratic Republic of Congo, Angola, and other areas of civil conflict, where 80% of some village populations may be infected. Cattle are the major reservoir of Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense, and humans are the major reservoir for T. b. gambiense. Incubation period is usually days to weeks with T. b. rhodesiense, and months to years with T. b. gambiense infections. Without treatment, both forms are usually fatal. Trypanosomiasis control strategies include human and cattle population surveys to treat infected persons and diminish cattle reservoirs, and tsetse fly habitat control (for example, removal of bushes and tall grasses near villages, and use of residual insecticides). Tuberculosis, malaria, bacterial meningitis, HIV/AIDS, and other central nervous system or systemic infections can produce similar clinical findings.﷐Surveillance goal﷐Increase percentage of cases confirmed by laboratory methods. Use population-based surveys and serologic screening for active case finding in endemic areas. Conduct human and cattle screening in trypanosomiasis-free areas.﷐Standard case definition﷐Suspected case: Early stage: a painful chancre originating as a papule and then evolving into a nodule at the primary fly bite site.

Clinically, the pulmonary form of the disease is more common than the extra-pulmonary form. The cardinal symptoms of pulmonary TB are chronic cough, weight loss, fever, loss of appetite and night sweats. Tuberculosis (TB) is a leading cause of infectious illness and death worldwide with over 8 million new cases and 3 million deaths per year. In African countries, approximately 1.6 million of the new cases and over 600 000 cases occur each year. It is also estimated that between 30 and 50% of all new TB cases detected are infected with HIV and 40% of all AIDS deaths are due to TB. Those who are at highest risk of dying from TB include people with HIV/AIDS, malnutrition and other immuno-compromising conditions, the very young, and the very old. The global HIV pandemic has been a major cause of increasing TB cases, especially in African countries. Incubation period is approximately 1 to 3 months. WHO recommends the Directly Observed Therapy, Short-course (DOTS) strategy to maximize compliance and treatment efficacy and to reduce development of drug-resistant strains. The DOTS strategy has been implemented by at least 40 of 46 Member States in the African Region.

287,289,"Background﷐Typhoid fever is a bacterial disease, caused by Salmonella typhi. Symptoms usually develop 1–3 weeks after exposure, and may be mild or severe. They include high fever, malaise, headache, constipation or diarrhoea, rose-coloured spots on the chest, and enlarged spleen and liver. Healthy carrier state may follow acute illness. Typhoid fever remains a serious public health problem throughout the world, with an estimated 16–33 million cases and 500 000 to 600 000 deaths annually.  In virtually all endemic areas, the incidence of typhoid fever is highest in children from 5–19 years old. The disease is almost exclusively transmitted by food and water contaminated by the faeces and urine of patients and carriers. Polluted water is the most common source of typhoid transmission. In addition, shellfish taken from sewage-contaminated beds, vegetables fertilized with night-soil and eaten raw, contaminated milk and milk products have been shown to be a source of infection. Typhoid fever has been virtually eliminated in most areas of the industrialized world with the advent of proper sanitary facilities. Most cases in developed countries are imported from endemic countries. People can transmit the disease as long as the bacteria remain in their body; most people are infectious prior to and during the first week of convalescence, but 10% of untreated patients will discharge bacteria for up to 3 months. Typhoid fever can be treated with antibiotics. However, resistance to common antimicrobials is widespread. Healthy carriers should be excluded from handling food.﷐Surveillance goal﷐Detect Typhoid Fever sporadic cases and outbreaks promptly, and seek laboratory verification Identify areas/population at high risk in order to improve prevention of the disease by taking hygienic measures﷐Standard case definitions﷐Suspected case: Any person with gradual onset of steadily increasing and then persistently high fever, chills, malaise, headache, sore throat, cough, and, sometimes, abdominal pain and constipation or diarrhoea. Confirmed case: Suspected case confirmed by isolation of Salmonella typhi from blood, bone marrow, bowel fluid or stool.",booklet6,2169

291,293,"Background﷐Many public health events that have shaped history started at the local level as an outbreak, spread with travel, and were due to unknown causes until they were later explained. It is the willingness to call an alert about uncertain and worrying events that is the sign of a functional public health system.  By their nature these events cannot be precisely described but scenarios have been used to help illustrate what might raise concern. The IHR regulations contain a ""decision instrument"" to guide WHO members (Refer to Section 2 of these guidelines). A ""yes"" answer to any two of the following four questions means that an event potentially constitutes a public health emergency of international concern that the WHO member must notify to WHO: (1) Is the public health impact of the event serious? (2) Is the event unusual or unexpected? (3) Is there a significant risk of international spread? (4) Is there a risk of restrictions on international travel or trade? The report that there is a possible outbreak or unusual event may come from different sources including:  routine analysis of surveillance data (e.g. from routine reporting indicates an unexpected increase in cases of a notifiable disease  a health worker (doctor, nurse or CHA, Environmental health Technician (EHT)) who reports a cluster of patients with a certain disease at their HCF or in the community  a community leader who notices an unusual health event in their community and reports it to the authorities  Continued reporting of these events from the local level are contingent on the willingness of the district, County/Regional and National levels to listen and give credibility to the local levels. The responsiveness of the system to these alerts will define the likelihood that they will be reported and vigilance continues.  A literature review into the important obstacles for reporting Public Health Events of International concern found the following:  Lack of knowledge among clinicians of the reporting process, including not knowing what diseases are reportable and not knowing what to report. Often there is confusion over who is responsible for reporting between the hospital and laboratory as well as confusion over whether laboratory confirmation is required prior to reporting.  A lack of understanding of how information acquired through reporting is used and a perception that reporting diseases is a useless endeavour.  The effect of actual or perceived negative consequences associated with reporting, such as extra work, intrusive requests for further information, media attention, judgment, punishment or blame, was stressed as an obstacle by multiple respondents.  Strategies to enhance completeness of notifiable disease reporting and IHR events include the following:  Provide clear information to frontline staff about  Why report unusual events?  What events are reportable?  How to report an unusual event?  What happens after you report?  Examples of event reporting: Strengthen the ability to ask questions and get immediate feedback between clinicians and other key partners to encourage more complete reporting, such as by providing access to public health professionals in the case of emergencies and establishing a 24-hour toll free phone number for reporting.  More frequent field visits or phone conferences can help as well.  Feedback to clinicians and others in the reporting chain, showing them that preventative action is being taken as a result of their notification, helps emphasize the need for timely and complete reporting. Providing feedback to those reporting could increase trust and transparency in the exchange of information about unusual events, improve the perception of how reported information is used and demonstrate the consequences of not reporting  All surveillance is built on good personal relationships or knowledge of the individuals involved in reporting. Encourage relationship building.   How reported information is handled:  The IHR has national focal points that contact their counterparts at WHO regional Offices. These regional offices enter epidemiological and other information necessary for risk analysis and management into an event management system that stores the information and makes it available. Feedback to countries through a national IHR focal point completes the reporting link and, if countries require support in outbreak response, a request is transmitted back to the WHO. This most recent guidance from WHO/AFRO focuses on Public Health Events (PHE) of initially unknown aetiology, which are PHEs for which the cause has not yet been determined. For such events, the One Health approach is recommended, where the ministry of health works in close collaboration with other ministries and multi-sectoral partners to enhance teamwork and improve efficiencies in preparedness, response, and monitoring and evaluation (M&E).﷐Surveillance goal﷐The assessment of whether an event may potentially be of international significance occurs at the national level, guided by Annex 2 of the IHR (2005) which is not intended to be used sub-nationally.  In this definition of an “event” or death sensitivity is prioritized to facilitate reporting and to reduce delays, emphasizing the fact that there should be no negative consequences f\or a potentially false signal.  Detect cases.  Immediate case-based reporting of all cases. Weekly summary reporting of cases for routine surveillance and outbreaks.",booklet6,5472

296,298,"Background﷐West Nile Fever is a febrile illness resulting from a mosquito-borne arbovirus in the Flavivirudae family. It is a zoonotic disease transmitted from birds to humans and other animals. Serological evidence suggests that the infection is present throughout practically the entire African continent. West Nile Fever most likely emerged in Africa and is now found world-wide. Outbreaks occur in humans, birds and horses. Most cases are mild and may not come to the attention of the health system. Patients seeking health care usually present with flu-like symptoms such as fever, headache and body aches. Occasionally patients present with a skin rash on the neck, trunk, arms or legs. People of all ages and conditions may be affected. However, those who are above age 50 years or who have had an organ transplant are at increased risk of severe illness. Very severe cases include signs of encephalitis, meningo-encephalitis or meningitis. Symptoms include high fever, headache, neck stiffness, stupor, tremors, convulsions, flaccid paralysis and coma. The case fatality rate in patients with neurological involvement ranges from 4% to 14% and as high as 29% in elderly patients. West Nile Fever can be prevented by avoiding mosquito bites especially at dusk when mosquitoes are most active. Insect repellents, wearing long sleeves and trousers, staying indoors and draining breeding sites like pools of standing water can reduce exposure to mosquitoes. Confirmation of West Nile Fever in patients with clinical symptoms requires laboratory confirmation of specific IgM antibodies in cerebrospinal fluid and serum specimens. Because there is no specific treatment for West Nile Fever, patients with severe disease are usually hospitalized for supportive treatment and nursing care.﷐Surveillance goal﷐Identify risk factors for infection and determine high-risk populations for targeted prevention activities Identify geographic areas for targeted prevention and control activities Identify most severe cases for referral to hospitalized care﷐Standard case definition﷐Suspected case: A hospitalized case of encephalitis due to unknown cause Confirmed case: Confirmation of West Nile Fever is through laboratory diagnostics to identify WNV-specific IgM",booklet6,2257

300,302,"Background﷐Endemic trepanometoses in the WHO African Region include two Neglected Tropical Diseases caused by two different sub species of Treponema pallidum (T.p.): yaws, due to T. p. pertenue and bejel caused by T. p. pallidum Yaws initially presents as a papilloma teemed with bacteria (primary yaws). The papilloma is a typical presentation of yaws and clinical diagnosis is straightforward. Without treatment, the papilloma will ulcerate. Papilloma and ulcers are very infectious and in the absence of treatment can quickly spread to other persons. Other clinical forms of yaws exist but they are not very infectious. Apart of papilloma and ulcers, other lesions of yaws and bejel range from macules, papules, nodules, plaques to secondary yaws that occurs weeks to months after the primary infection and typically presents with multiple raised yellow lesions or pain and swelling of long bones and fingers (dactylitis).  Yaws spreads in inter-tropical areas, in humid and warm zones such as equatorial rain forests and their surroundings, while bejel is found in most dry and arid regions such as the Sahel trip  Children from 2 to 14 years old are the most affected age-group, especially in school-age children where outbreaks of yaws or bejel could be observed Yaws treatment which was based on single injection of long lasting penicillin (benzathine benzyl penicillin) has improved greatly by the confirmation of the efficacy of a single dose of Azithromycin for curing yaws lesion in 2010. Further to this confirmation, the WHO has designed a yaws eradication strategy, titled “The Morges Strategy” from the name of a city near Geneva, where the Strategy was drafted in 2012. This eradication strategy consists mainly in mass administration of azithromycin (MAA) to at-risk communities and achieving at least 90% coverage of targeted populations The mode of transmission is through direct contact with skin lesions or items already contaminated by primary lesions (papilloma and ulcers)  Confirmation of diagnosis is done by dual treponemal and non-treponemal rapid tests, a syphilis test which is not specific for yaws followed by a dual path platform (DPP) test which is specific for T. p; pertenue. These rapid tests can be performed in the fields and are able to detect recent and past infections﷐Surveillance goal﷐Yaws is targeted for eradication by 2020, eradication being defined as complete interruption of transmission (zero new case of yaws) globally.

302,304,"Background﷐Yellow fever virus is an RNA that belongs to the genus Flavivirus and is related to West Nile, St. Louis encephalitis, and Japanese encephalitis viruses.  It is  ransmitted human-to-human via the domestic species of Aedes mosquitoes (Urban epidemics) or to humans from primate reservoir via a forest mosquito species (Sylvatic cycle). Large scale outbreaks occur every 3 to 10 years in villages or cities in the absence of large scale immunisation. Sporadic cases can occur regularly in endemic areas. Resurgence of disease in Africa since mid-1980s.

305,307,Zika virus disease,booklet6,18
306,308,"Background ﷐﷐﷐﷐﷐Zika virus is a flavivirus that is transmitted primarily through the bite of an infected mosquito, primarily Aedes aegypti, and also Aedes albopictus, the same mosquitoes that transmit dengue, chikungunya, and yellow fever. Zika virus can also be transmitted in-utero from mother to fetus, and through sexual contact, blood transfusion, and organ transplantation.  Zika virus infections are usually asymptomatic. When symptoms occur, they tend to be mild and include mild fever, rash, conjunctivitis, and muscle and joint pain that last for 2 to 7 days. There is no specific treatment but symptoms can be treated with common fever medicines, rest and drinking fluids.    Zika virus infection during pregnancy can result in preterm birth, fetal loss, stillbirth, and congenital malformations including microcephaly, limb contractures, eye abnormalities, brain calcifications, and other manifestations of Congenital Zika Syndrome.    Zika virus is also associated with an increased risk of Guillain-Barré syndrome, and other neurological complications requiring close medical management and possibly intensive care and mechanical ventilation.  History Zika virus was first identified in 1947 in a rhesus monkey the Zika forest of Uganda, and was first identified in humans in 1952 in Uganda and the United Republic of Tanzania. Over the following decades, Zika virus caused rare, sporadic cases of disease in Africa and Asia, generally causing mild and self-limited illness of fever, rash, malaise, and other mild symptoms.  The first outbreaks were reported in Yap Island (Federated States of Micronesia) in 2007 and French Polynesia in 2013. The virus subsequently spread to other Pacific islands including New Caledonia, Cook Islands, Vanuatu and Easter Island (Chile), Fiji, Samoa, Solomon Islands, and Vanuatu. Zika virus was not known to cause severe disease until the 2013-2014 outbreak in French Polynesia, where increased incidence of Guillain-Barré Syndrome was first reported.  The Zika virus outbreak in the Region of the Americas began in Brazil in 2015; in July 2015, Brazil reported an association between Zika virus infection and Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) and few months later, in October 2015, an association between Zika virus infection and microcephaly. Since 2015, outbreaks of Zika virus disease have now been recorded in Africa, the Americas, Asia and the Pacific; to date, 86 countries and territories have confirmed evidence of mosquito-borne  Zika transmission.  Since 2017, Zika virus transmission in the Americas has waned, but transmission continues with intermittent areas of emergence and re-emergence. In the African Region, only rare, sporadic Zika virus infection had been reported until 2015. Since 2015, outbreaks of Zika virus have been reported in Cabo Verde, Guinea-Bissau, and Angola. There are two strains of Zika virus known as the African and Asian strains. The Asian strain was associated with the outbreaks in the Pacific and in the Americas. The Asian strain was also identified in the Cabo Verde outbreak and in Angola. In Angola, a cluster of microcephaly was reported in 2017-2018, and introduction of the epidemic (Brazilian) Asian strain was confirmed, including among infants born with microcephaly. To date, microcephaly has only been identified following infection with the Asian strain. Little information is available on the spectrum of disease and pregnancy risk associated with the African strain. Aedes mosquitoes that transmit Zika, dengue, yellow fever, and chikungunya primarily bite during daylight hours.  Aedes sp. breed in small collections of water such as in trash, used tyres, flower pots, and open water storage containers. Efforts to prevent transmission focus on elimination of these breeding sites around homes and near other areas of human-vector contact such as around schools and work sites. Other prevention strategies include use of personal protection measures such as use of protective clothing, insect repellent, and screens on windows and doors.﷐﷐﷐﷐﷐Surveillance goals﷐﷐﷐﷐﷐﷐﷐﷐﷐﷐The goal of surveillance is to develop, strengthen and implement integrated surveillance systems at all levels for Zika virus disease, its complications, and other arboviral diseases and their vectors, in order to provide up-to-date and accurate epidemiological and entomological information to guide response. Existing surveillance systems should be enhanced for early detection and reporting of Zika virus and unusual clusters of neurological disorders or birth defects.  Timely notification of any event compatible with Zika virus is important, and in particular any associated with neurological disorders and neonatal malformations through established channels, including IHR. The establishment or strengthening of event-based or syndromic surveillance should be supported, potentially targeting specific groups for surveillance, such as pregnant women through antenatal and postnatal care, sentinel based surveillance systems for birth defects and Guillain-Barré syndrome, and existing lab-based disease specific surveillance systems (e.g. measles, polio) to facilitate detection of Zika virus infection and associated disorders. Given the common vector and epidemiologic transmission patterns of dengue, Zika, and chikungunya calls for an integrated arbovirus surveillance. ﷐﷐﷐﷐﷐﷐Standard case definitions﷐﷐﷐﷐﷐Suspected Case:  A person presenting with rash and/or fever and at least one of the following signs or symptoms: arthralgia; or arthritis; or conjunctivitis (non-purulent/hyperaemic). Probable case: A suspected case with presence of IgM antibody against Zika virus and an epidemiological link (with no evidence of infection with other flaviviruses).  Confirmed case: A person with laboratory confirmation of recent Zika virus infection: presence of Zika virus RNA or antigen in serum or other samples (e.g. saliva, urine, tissue, whole blood); or IgM antibody against Zika virus positive and PRNT90 for Zika virus with titre ≥20 and Zika virus PRNT90 titre ratio ≥ 4 compared to other flaviviruses; and exclusion of other flaviviruses.  These case definitions may change based on new knowledge. ﷐﷐﷐﷐﷐Response to Zika virus disease﷐﷐﷐﷐﷐    If Zika virus cases are suspected: Immediately report suspected cases to the next level using the case-based reporting form. Collect specimens for laboratory confirmation of cases  Conduct active search for additional cases. Strengthen event-based surveillance to detect the emergence of clusters of cases presenting with rash and febrile syndrome of unknown aetiology. Conduct an investigation to determine risk factors for transmission. Manage and treat cases with supportive care.      If Zika virus cases are confirmed: Coordination and leadership Develop a national contingency plan for the prevention and control of Zika virus transmission and disease. Reinforce the Incident Management System to strengthen their coordination [including emergency operations center (EOC)] to include the preparedness to respond to Zika, dengue, chikungunya and yellow fever. Actively engage other sectors (e.g., environment, agriculture, tourism) to respond to Zika virus through a multi-sectoral approach (One Health approach).  Surveillance, data management and laboratory Notify WHO through Ministry of Health using the IHR decision instrument. Enhance surveillance of Zika virus disease and of the conditions that may be associated with it, including microcephaly and congenital Zika syndrome and Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS). Enhance surveillance at prenatal and postnatal clinics to monitor possible congenital infections and complications. Conduct active search for additional cases.  Ensure the rapid and timely reporting and sharing of information of Zika virus disease using the IDSR/IHR tools. Ensure proper collection, transport, and storage of specimens for laboratory diagnostic testing. Conduct community-based assessments to determine the abundance of vector mosquitoes, identify the most productive larval habitats, promote and implement plans for appropriate vector control. Report any identified unusual increase in the incidence of congenital neurological malformations including microcephaly in neonates and adverse pregnancy outcomes not explained through alternate causes, to the relevant public health authorities using IDSR framework.  Vector control and personal protection: Zika virus disease Intensification of efforts to reduce mosquito populations including elimination of potential breeding sites (e.g., removal of trash and standing water sites around homes, covering home water storage containers, and use of larvicides) and adult mosquito control methods. Promotion of personal protection measures such as use of light-coloured protective clothing (long sleeves and pants), insect repellent, and physical barriers such as screens, closed doors and windows, and sleeping under mosquito nets including during the day when Aedes mosquitoes are most active. All operators and other persons involved in vector control, such as larvicide application and indoor residual spraying, should be given protective measures including personal protective equipment.   Social mobilization, community engagement and communication Develop risk communication messages to address population concerns, enhance community engagement, improve reporting, and ensure application of vector control and personal protective measures targeting reduction of contact with the vector. Provide women of childbearing age and particularly pregnant women with the necessary information and materials on family planning and to reducing risk of exposure. Provide clinical and psychosocial support services for affected children and families.  Transmission prevention and case management Engage community health workers to inform them of the disease and risks and to build capacity Reinforce preventative measures for pregnant women through targeted interventions (including primary antenatal, postnatal and neonatal health care settings). Pregnant women who feel they may have been exposed to Zika virus may wish to consult with their health-care providers for laboratory testing for Zika virus infection, ultrasound assessment, and close monitoring throughout pregnancy, labor, delivery, and the post-natal period. After delivery, all infants should have head circumference measured and be examined for evidence of congenital malformations, including microcephaly, eye abnormalities, limb contractures, and other anomalies associated with congenital Zika syndrome.  http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/204475/1/WHO_ZIKV_MOC_16.3_eng.pdf?ua=1 Zika can be transmitted through blood and blood products. Precautions already in place for ensuring safe blood donations, transfusions, and prevention of bloodborne pathogens should be followed. Zika can be transmitted sexually. Men and women need to get counselling on safer sexual practices, and be offered condoms and full range of contraceptive methods.   Ensure that pregnant women who have been exposed to Zika virus be counselled and followed for birth outcomes based on the best available information and national practice and policies. Refer most severe cases with complication to hospitalized cares.  Operational research Evaluate methods for practical, sustainable surveillance for Zika virus transmission, including strategies for integrated arbovirus surveillance. Conduct studies including case-control studies to investigate disease outcomes of infants exposed in-utero to Zika virus infection.  Promote research in the areas of vaccines, drugs, diagnostics, vector biology and appropriate mosquito control methods. Entomological surveillance of Aedes mosquitoes is used for operational research purposes to determine changes in geographical distribution, for monitoring and evaluating control programmes, for obtaining relative measurements of the vector population over time, and for facilitating appropriate and timely decisions regarding interventions.  Sampling of Aedes mosquitoes, pupae and oviposition should be conducted.  As part of entomological surveillance, insecticide resistance monitoring in field populations of Aedes should be conducted to identify and select the appropriate insecticides.   NB:  Application of strategic intervention in different country contexts: The described interventions will be packaged and applied in countries depending on the context. In countries where there is the spread of Zika virus as well as the associated complications, a full suite of strategies will be applied from enhanced surveillance, engaging communities, vector control and personal protective measures, care for people with complications and public health research to better understand risk and evaluate mitigation measures. For countries are already experiencing widespread Zika transmission or presence of Aedes vectors, enhanced surveillance should be put in place, communities engaged, and vector control and personal protective measures enhanced. For all other countries, risk communications for the public regarding trade and travel will be the main line of engagement. Table 1 below outlines the application of the strategies in the varying country context. Table 1: Application of strategies to country context﷐﷐﷐﷐﷐Country Context﷐Engage communities communicate risks﷐Monitor for Zika virus transmission and disease﷐Control transmission and prevent exposure﷐Manage complications associated  with Zika virus﷐Investigate associated risks﷐Aedes + Zika virus + associated complications﷐﷐﷐﷐﷐﷐Aedes + Zika virus﷐﷐﷐﷐﷐﷐Aedes ﷐﷐﷐﷐﷐﷐Other ﷐﷐﷐﷐﷐﷐ ﷐Analysis and interpretation of data﷐﷐﷐﷐﷐Time: Graph cases of Zika virus infection, Guillain-Barré syndrome, and deaths weekly, by date of onset of symptoms.

47,49,FOREWORD,booklet1,8
48,50,"In 1998, the World Health Organization (WHO) Regional Office for Africa (AFRO) together with technical partners adopted a strategy for developing and implementing comprehensive public health surveillance and response systems in African countries, initially called integrated disease surveillance (IDS). However, to highlight the linkage between surveillance and response, the strategy was later re-named Integrated Disease Surveillance and Response (IDSR). Malawi adopted the first edition of the IDSR technical guidelines in 2005. Since then, there has been an investment in human and material resources to strengthen capacities for public health surveillance systems in order to prevent, timely detect, and respond appropriately to public health threats. ",booklet1,757
49,51,"The coming into force, in 2007, of the International Health Regulations (IHR 2005), the emergence of new diseases, conditions and events and the formulation of strategies for disaster risk management (DRM) resulted in the need to revise the first edition of the IDSR technical guidelines. There was also the need to address the increasing burden of non-communicable diseases. Furthermore, there was the need to strengthen community-based surveillance for early detection, rapid confirmation and response to public health threats. Moreover, alignment with broader system strengthening objectives was required. Hence, in 2010, the second edition of the IDSR guidelines was developed, which Malawi subsequently adapted in 2014.",booklet1,724
50,52,"Diseases, both communicable and non-communicable, continue to be a major cause of morbidity and mortality in Malawi and in the Africa region as a whole despite the advanced global knowledge on how to detect and control them. Of late, non-communicable diseases are increasingly becoming a major public health problem in the country. The majority of non-communicable diseases are preventable but multiple factors which include environmental, social, and economic determinants hamper effective prevention and control of these diseases. Emerging and re-emerging diseases and conditions pose a threat to the country’s health security. ",booklet1,630
51,53,"Responding to health emergencies remains a major challenge, as shown by recent health emergencies in the country as well as the African region, the unprecedented Ebola Virus Disease of 2014, the ongoing Coronavirus Disease of 2019 Pandemic. Specifically, challenges in capacity to prevent, detect and respond to public health threats have been identified. As one way of addressing these problems, the Ministry of Health is strengthening the disease surveillance systems using the Third Edition of the guidelines for IDSR as revised by the WHO-AFRO in 2018 and adapted to our context in 2020.",booklet1,591
52,54,"It is worth noting that, many Public Health Events (PHEs) and emergencies and their associated risk factors could be prevented or their effects mitigated. However, the health systems in most countries remain inadequate. To avert and mitigate the effects of future health security risks and emergencies, Malawi intends to  implement these IDSR technical guidelines. These guidelines recommend thresholds for action for priority diseases, conditions, public health events and responding to alerts. Using these action thresholds can be lifesaving. Therefore, it is important that we scale up and fully implement this third edition of the IDSR technical guidelines in the country as they explicitly describe what needs to be established at each level of the health system in order to detect, confirm and respond to diseases, conditions and health events that are responsible for  illness, deaths and disability in local communities.",booklet1,928
53,55,"The cost of good public health surveillance as a public health good is relatively very low compared to many other strategies. Let us all embrace these IDSR technical guidelines to strengthen capacities for preparedness, alert and response for health security in the country.",booklet1,274
54,56,"These guidelines are to be used by all relevant multisectoral stakeholders at all levels as general reference for surveillance activities, set of standard definitions for threshold levels that initiate action for responding to specific diseases, stand-alone reference for level-specific responsibilities, resource for developing training, supervision, monitoring and evaluation of surveillance activities, and as a guide for improving early detection and response of epidemic prone diseases.",booklet1,491
55,57,"Finally, I appeal to you all to ensure that the third edition of the IDSR technical guidelines are implemented within a broader context of health system strengthening; better coordination between human and animal health surveillance and other sectors involved in One Health approach; improved use of laboratory network capacity in surveillance and response; and better community engagement in public health interventions.",booklet1,421

66,68,1.1 Introduction ,booklet1,17
67,69,"This section introduces the concepts of Integrated Disease Surveillance and Response (IDSR), which incorporates indicator-based and event-based surveillance as integral parts of an Early Warning Alert and Response System (EWARS). The section also provides guidance on how IDSR works, the objectives of IDSR, and how IDSR can help to build and sustain the International Health Regulation (IHR) core capacities, thereby facilitating the implementation of IHR.  Furthermore, this section introduces other aspects such as; the One Health approach; the linkage between Disaster Risk Management (DRM) and IDSR; the core surveillance functions; how sub-national levels (for example districts) can use these guidelines to strengthen surveillance and response; the roles and responsibilities of the various actors at different levels; and finally, the priority diseases, conditions and events recommended in Malawi IDSR. ",booklet1,912
68,70,"It is important to emphasize from the onset that these guidelines are to help build and strengthen surveillance systems for priority diseases, conditions and all other public health events, whether they are known or unknown, whether they are disease events or other IHR hazards.  These guidelines are NOT limited to only known diseases. ",booklet1,337
69,71,1.2 Public Health Surveillance,booklet1,30
70,72,"Public Health Surveillance is the ongoing systematic identification, collection, collation, analysis, and interpretation of disease occurrence and public health event data to take timely and robust action. It includes the timely dissemination of the resulting information to those who need to know for effective and appropriate action. Surveillance is also essential for planning, implementation, monitoring and evaluation of public health practice. Malawi has decided to achieve its public health surveillance objectives through the implementation of the IDSR strategy.",booklet1,570
71,73,1.2.1 Definition of the different types/approaches of public health surveillance,booklet1,80
72,74,"Passive surveillance: A system by which, a health institution receives routine reports submitted from health facilities (hospitals, clinics, public health units, or community or other sources). There is no active search for cases. This is the most common, and it includes the surveillance of diseases and other public health events using routine surveillance; routine Health Management and Information System (HMIS) or any other public health information system,",booklet1,462
73,75,"Active surveillance:  It involves an ongoing search for cases in the community or the health facilities. This may involve regular contacts with key reporting sources, such as telephone calls to health care workers at a facility or laboratory or physically moving to the source and records review of data. Examples include active search of cases of measles and polio, as well as during outbreaks where one must institute mechanisms for active finding of additional cases. ",booklet1,471
74,76,"Integrated Disease Surveillance: It is an approach that aims at collecting health data for multiple diseases using standardized tools. To ensure robust early warning and prompt response, the IDSR data collection and analysis system relies on two main channels of information or signal generation, namely: 1) Indicator-Based Surveillance (IBS) and 2) Event-Based Surveillance (EBS).",booklet1,381
75,77,1.2.1.1 Indicator-based surveillance ,booklet1,37
76,78,"Indicator-based surveillance is the systematic (regular) identification, collection, monitoring, analysis and interpretation of structured data, such as indicators produced by a number of well-identified, mostly health facility-based, formal sources.",booklet1,250
77,79,What are the common methods of indicator-based surveillance?,booklet1,60
78,80,"Facility-based surveillance: All reporting units (e.g., health facilities) are required to report on a weekly, monthly, quarterly or annual basis to the next level based on the categories of the diseases, conditions and events. Additionally, they are also required to report immediately, any epidemic prone disease to the next level.",booklet1,333
79,81,"Case based surveillance: Case-based surveillance involves the ongoing and rapid identification of identifiable cases for purposes of case follow-up. It is the type of surveillance used for diseases that are targeted for elimination or eradication or during confirmed outbreaks. In these scenarios, every individual case identified is reported immediately, using a case based form to the next level",booklet1,397
80,82,"Sentinel surveillance: This type of surveillance is done for specific conditions in a specific cohort such as in a geographical area or population subgroup to estimate trends in a larger population. A given number of health facilities or reporting sites are usually designated as sentinel sites for monitoring rate of occurrence of priority events such as pandemic or epidemic events and other Public Health Events (PHEs) of public health importance and they act as early warning and reporting sites. Sentinel sites are usually designated because they are representative of an area or are in an area of likely risk for a disease or condition of concern. Examples of sentinel surveillance include: sentinel surveillance for Influenza, Rotavirus, Paediatric Bacterial Meningitis (PBM) and environmental sewage sampling for polio.",booklet1,827
81,83,"Syndromic surveillance: An active or passive system that uses Standard Case Definitions based entirely on clinical features without any laboratory diagnosis. Few examples include; - collecting the number of cases of Acute Flaccid Paralysis (AFP) as an alert for polio; or acute watery diarrhoea among people aged two years and older as an alert for cholera; or ""rash illness"" as an alert for measles; or Acute Haemorrhagic Fever (AHF) as an alert for viral haemorrhagic diseases, or Severe Acute Respiratory Infection (SARI) or Influenza-Like Illness (ILI) as alerts for influenza. Because of the lack of specificity of this system, reports require more investigation from higher levels. ",booklet1,688
82,84,"Laboratory-based surveillance: This consists of surveillance conducted at laboratories for detecting events or trends that may not be seen as a problem at other locations or that originates from laboratory testing mainly done routinely or used when conducting sentinel surveillance. Laboratories can be the source of an initial alert for a specific outbreak or public health event that necessitates further epidemiological investigations. For example, the laboratory may be the first to detect the emergence of resistant strains in the community such as multi-drug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB). Other examples of laboratory-based surveillance include virological surveillance as influenza and bacteriological surveillance such as Antimicrobial resistance surveillance system. Recently, WHO has established a Global Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance System (GLASS), which is a surveillance system for clinical specimens and is focusing initially on priority human bacterial infections namely E. coli, K. pneumonia, S. aureus, S. pneumoniae, Salmonella spp., Shigella spp and N. gonorrheae. This type of laboratory surveillance provides information about antimicrobial resistance incidence, prevalence, and trends. Malawi is part of GLASS and is currently monitoring the priority bacterial infections listed above in 9 sites across the country.",booklet1,1349
83,85,"Disease-specific surveillance: This involves surveillance activities aimed at targeted health data for a specific disease for vertical surveillance. Examples include Tuberculosis, Malaria and HIV surveillance systems.",booklet1,217
84,86,"Community Based Surveillance (CBS):  Defined as the systematic detection and reporting of events of public health significance within the community by community members. CBS incorporates both Indicator-based and Event-based surveillance methods.  In CBS, there are identified focal person(s) e.g. Community volunteer who report cases or events to the designated focal point, Health Surveillance Assistants (HSA) within the nearby local health delivery points. Community based surveillance strategies focus on two approaches to collect community information. The first one relies on identifying and reporting events based on agreed indicators (lay case definitions). For example, trusted community members are trained to identify diseases such as measles, cholera, polio and Neonatal Tetanus, using community (lay) case definitions and use standardized reporting system to the next level. The second strategy relies on reporting of unusual events (alerts) which can alert early stages of an outbreak or any other public health threat in the community. Alerts may capture a wide variety of unusual events emerging at the community level and information from these alerts may be incomplete and unconfirmed and as such they all need to be triaged and verified.  Information using this strategy can also come from people who have already been oriented on the agreed indicators (lay case definitions) for example the community volunteers, or may be any other representatives from the community, who have been oriented to detect events like unusual animal deaths and report to the next level. Often Village Health Committees (VHCs) would link the patient identified through any of the strategies, to nearby health facility and can help identify contacts. ",booklet1,1748
85,87,1.2.1.2 Event- Based Surveillance (EBS),booklet1,39
86,88,"Event-based surveillance is the organized and rapid capture of information about events that are of potential risk to public health. Information is initially captured as an alert which is considered by the Early Warning Alert and Response system as an alert representing potential acute risk to human health, such as an outbreak. All alerts may not necessarily become real events, as such they all need to be triaged and verified before a response is initiated. Alerts which may signify potential risks may include:",booklet1,515
87,89,"Occurrence of disease in humans, such as unexplained clustered cases of a disease or syndromes, unusual disease patterns or unexpected deaths as recognized by health workers and other key informants in the community; ",booklet1,217
88,90,"Events related to potential exposure for humans, such as events related to diseases and deaths in animals, contaminated food products or water, and environmental hazards including chemical and radio-nuclear events.",booklet1,214
89,91,"Alerts of potential exposure of human beings by biological, chemical or radiological and nuclear hazards, or occurrence of natural or man-made disasters. ",booklet1,154
90,92,"Event based surveillance also involves media monitoring and this entails the regular scanning of- newspapers, internet sites and media alert systems e.g. ProMed, blogs, social media, newspapers, radios, and television. ",booklet1,219
91,93,Event based Surveillance systems are very sensitive. Information received through event-based surveillance should be synchronized with IBS and rapidly assessed for the risk the event poses to public health and responded to appropriately (illustrated in Figure 1).,booklet1,263
92,94,"Unlike indicator-based surveillance, event-based surveillance is not based on the routine monitoring of indicators and automated thresholds for action but rather on the screening of ALL available information to detect any event happening in the community (unusual disease or deaths in humans or animals, unusual or clustering of cases, events/conditions in the community, including environmental conditions). ",booklet1,409
93,95,Intersection of IBS and EBS: All events detected in the EBS system that are investigated and meet the standard case definition should be captured in the IBS system and reported to the next level of health care system.,booklet1,217
94,96,"NB: IBS and EBS are complementary sources of information, and both contribute to the early warning function critical for a prompt and proportioned response. The two are not necessarily separate surveillance systems; both are processed through a single activity and some of the surveillance functions might be common to both types.",booklet1,330
95,97,Figure 1: Indicator-based and event-based surveillance for Early Warning Alert and Response System (EWARS) for IDSR Strategy,booklet1,124
96,98,1.2.3 Event- based surveillance (EBS) and Indicator-Based Surveillance (IBS) as back-bone to the IDSR Strategy,booklet1,110
97,99,"Event-based Surveillance (EBS) and Indicator-Based Surveillance (IBS) are components of Early Warning Alert and Response (EWAR) and epidemic intelligence incorporated in the IDSR strategy. Both EBS and IBS are complimentary with each having a different role to play and purpose. EBS is most likely to pick up alerts to detect small outbreaks early, while IBS is better in monitoring disease trends over time and useful for signalling the start of regular seasonal outbreaks of endemic diseases using alert and epidemic thresholds. IBS may not be useful for smaller events because alerts are either averaged out in large data sets, or lost in smaller data sets. EBS is also better at picking up alerts indicating outbreaks in areas where access to healthcare is limited. In the context of IDSR strategy, the flow of EBS information follows the same reporting lines as IBS i.e. from community to health facility to district and to national level. EBS and IBS are applied at all levels of the health system namely community, health facility, district and national levels (Illustrated in figure 2).",booklet1,1094
98,100,Figure 2: Levels of Applications and Reporting of EBS and IBS in the context of IDSR,booklet1,84
99,101,1.3 Integrated Disease Surveillance and Response strategy,booklet1,57
100,102,"Integrated Disease Surveillance and Response (IDSR) strategy was adopted by WHO AFRO member states in September 1998 as the approach for improving public health surveillance and response for priority diseases, conditions and events at community, health facility, district and national level. IDSR promotes rational and efficient use of resources by integrating and streamlining common surveillance activities and functions. The IDSR strategy makes surveillance and laboratory data more usable, and this helps public health managers and decision-makers improve detection and response to the leading causes of illness, death and disability in African countries including Malawi. As part of improvement of the healthcare system, IDSR strategy also assists countries to better monitor and track planned targets and ensure that they are achieved in a timely manner.",booklet1,860
101,103,"Surveillance activities for different diseases involve similar functions (detection, sample collection, reporting, analysis and interpretation, feedback, action) and often use the same structures, processes and personnel. As such, the principles of surveillance are the same whether applied to a single disease, condition or event or multiple diseases. What may differ is whether the target is elimination or eradication, which may require time-limited intensive efforts aimed at proving the absence of disease. ",booklet1,512
102,104,What takes place in an integrated system?,booklet1,41
103,105,"All surveillance activities are coordinated and streamlined. Rather than using scarce resources to maintain multiple surveillance systems with separate vertical activities, resources are combined to collect, manage and analyse information at a single focal point at each level.",booklet1,277
104,106,"Several activities are combined into one integrated activity, and take advantage of similar surveillance functions, skills, resources and target populations. For example, surveillance activities for Acute Flaccid Paralysis (AFP) often address surveillance for neonatal tetanus, measles and other Vaccine Preventable Diseases (VPDs) or any unusual events. Thus, health workers who routinely visit health facilities to search for AFP cases also review district and health facility records for information about other priority diseases in the area. HSAs interact with their community members on a regular basis and ask about a range of diseases, conditions and events; communities know they can bring anything unusual to the attention of their focal persons, or through their VHCs.",booklet1,778
105,107,"The district level is the hub and focus for integrating surveillance functions. The district is the first level in the local health system, which has dedicated staff in all aspects of public health such as planning as well as supporting implementation of Health Sector Strategic Plan (HSSP), monitoring health events in the health facility, and in the community, mobilizing community action, asking for national assistance to protect the district’s health. Similar functions also occur at the various administrative levels.",booklet1,523
106,108,Surveillance focal points at the district and national levels collaborate with emergency response committees at each level to plan relevant public health response actions and actively seek opportunities for combining resources.,booklet1,227
107,109,"The focus is on the creation of an overall public health surveillance system with sufficient capacity for detecting, confirming and responding to diseases, conditions and events. IDSR ensures that the information flow is bi-directional (horizontal and vertical), so that each level is informed of potential outbreaks and response interventions in a timely manner. ",booklet1,364
108,110,"Integration refers to efficient use of human resource and harmonizing different methods, software, data collection forms, standards and case definitions in order to prevent inconsistent information and maximize efforts among all disease prevention and control programmes and stakeholders. Where possible, a common reporting form, a single data entry system for multiple diseases, and common communication channels are used.

IHR (2005) is therefore not a separate surveillance system but rather requires countries to put in place a “sensitive, reliable and flexible surveillance system that meets international standards”. IDSR is a system with that potential and it will ensure a reliable supply of information to the national level in order to fulfil IHR requirements. The IHR (2005) provides an opportunity to address the threat to international public health security and trade caused by emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases including PHEIC.

In the IHR (2005) guideline, all public health conditions and events of international concern (PHEIC) should be detected, assessed and responded to timely, using an adapted response rather than pre-set measures. The IHR (2005) guidelines also include the measures at points of entry (airports, ports and ground crossing) and containment at source of public health events. IHR (2005) guidelines also includes capturing rumours of “unexplained illness or clusters” as an event category for reporting from lower levels. Because of the major role IHR (2005) plays for timely detection and verification of suspected public health emergencies and events, event-based surveillance is now part of IDSR and the IHR.",booklet1,770

146,148,Figure 4: IHR monitoring and evaluation framework,booklet1,49
147,149,1.5 One Health and IDSR,booklet1,23
148,150,"One Health is an approach to address a shared health threat at the human-animal-environment interface based on collaboration, communication, and coordination across all relevant sectors and disciplines, with the ultimate goal of achieving optimal health outcomes for both people and animals. A One Health approach applies to the local, regional, national, and global levels. Humans and animals (domestic and wildlife) share the same eco-system and the opportunities for spill-over of diseases are increasing with modern trends in globalization, growing population pressures, climate change, economic development, mass urbanization, and increasing demand for animal-sourced foods.  ",booklet1,681
149,151,"The One Health approach is intrinsic to and strongly reinforced by WHO’s IHR (2005) and the IDSR strategy as well as other global health frameworks. The One Health approach applies toward improving indicator and event-based surveillance, which is cornerstone for the early warning function of the IDSR. Animal and human health workers as well as other relevant partners should be engaged at various levels to be information sources for IDSR to further facilitate information sharing and joint rapid response activities.  The One Health approach offers a comprehensive framework for IHR (2005) implementation, helping to address Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) of all sources. The key principles of the One Health approach include prevention and control of emerging infectious diseases (reference to internationally adopted standards i.e. IHR (2005) and OIE (World Organization for Animal Health) international standards), and support for national public health services and build on the existing structures.  ",booklet1,1034
150,152,"This principle of One Health approach also considers the role of changing environments with regard to infectious and chronic disease risks affecting humans and animals. By utilizing data, expertise and management approaches in the environment, Environmental health practitioners can assist in enhancing the understanding of the root causes of diseases, and better account for complexity of environmental factors. ",booklet1,413
151,153,"A strong functional IDSR thus requires improved communication, coordination and collaboration from all sectors for the implementation of an effective One Health framework. Thus the Malawi National Focal Point for IHR (NFP) has incorporated the animal and environmental health sectors to effectively implement IHR (2005) through IDSR in a One Health approach.",booklet1,358
152,154,1.6 IDSR and Disaster Risk Management (DRM),booklet1,43
153,155,"Disaster is defined as the serious disruption of the functioning of a community or a society, causing widespread human, material, economic or environmental losses exceeding the ability of the affected community or society to cope using its own resources. In 2012, the African region member states, including Malawi, adopted the Disaster Risk Management (DRM): A strategy for the health sector in the African Region, which aims to comprehensively address DRM.",booklet1,458
154,156,"Disaster Risk Management (DRM) is defined as the systematic process of using administrative and organizational directives, operational skills and capacities to implement strategies, policies and improved coping capacities in order to lessen the adverse impact of hazards and the possibility of disaster. DRM is driven by conducting Hazard Analysis, followed by the assessment on the level of vulnerability and available coping capacity. The ultimate objective of DRM is reducing risk by reducing vulnerability or improving the capacity to mitigate impact of a hazard. IDSR is an important tool in the DRM, as it provides early warning information, which is crucial for risk assessment and ultimately, risk reduction. IDSR assists in identification of hazards, assessment, risk communication and monitoring of disaster risks, and hence enhance early warning component.",booklet1,867
155,157,1.7 Implementing Cross Border activities in the context of IDSR ,booklet1,64
156,158,"Given the ecological distribution of communicable diseases and the porosity of international borders, it is imperative that countries in the region work together to control and contain them.  The free movement of people and goods across the borders within the region provides opportunities for cross-border spread of diseases. In addition, in the urban centres located at border points a disaster on one side of the border can easily affect the health of a large number of people on both sides of the borders. It is therefore logical that countries in the region engage each other in coordinated and synchronized implementation of interventions so as to control the communicable diseases in the region. Developing cross-border framework will therefore provide an opportunity for countries to initiate and strengthen priority cross-border activities for disease control, including but not limited to disease surveillance, epidemic preparedness and outbreak control as well as building core capacities to ensure compliance to the International Health Regulations (IHR (2005). Malawi has since established cross-border framework with its neighbouring countries Zambia, Mozambique and Tanzania and will work on the following to enhance compliance and build the core capacities",booklet1,1272

180,182,1.9 Description of Surveillance functions as described in these guidelines,booklet1,74
181,183,"These guidelines assume that all levels of the health system are involved in conducting surveillance activities for detecting and responding to priority diseases, conditions and events (even though the different levels do not perform identical functions). These activities include the following core functions:",booklet1,310
182,184,"Step 1 – Identify and record cases, conditions and events: Use of standard case definitions for health service delivery points (human, animal and environment), simplified case definition for community level, in identifying priority diseases, conditions, and identify alerts that can signal emerging public health events. Additionally, case identification can also be done through other health service delivery points (animal and environment) using formal health systems, private health systems or community structures. Case definitions and a functioning alert and verification system are vital for detecting cases and outbreaks. After identification, all alerts including true events must be recorded in a recognized register including the line list register.",booklet1,759
183,185,"Step  2 – Report: Suspected cases or conditions or events to the next level for action. If this is an epidemic prone disease or a potential PHEIC, or a disease targeted for elimination or eradication, respond immediately by investigating the case or event, collecting the necessary diagnostic sample and submitting a detailed report. For events to be notified under IHR to WHO, the National Focal Point (NFP) will use the decision instrument (Annex C) to identify any potential PHEIC. ",booklet1,485
184,186,"Step  3 –  Analyse (person, place and time) and interpret findings: Surveillance data should be compiled, analysed for trends, compared with data from previous periods and interpreted for use in public health actions. ",booklet1,218
185,187,"Step 4 – Investigate and confirm suspected cases, outbreak or event: Case/outbreak confirmation involves the epidemiological investigation of suspected cases and capacity of the laboratory to make confirmation. Take action to ensure that the case and contacts, outbreak or event is investigated and is laboratory confirmed. Capacity for case confirmation is enhanced through improved referral systems, networking and partnerships. Gather evidence about what may have caused the outbreak or event, by including also non-human sources of information e.g. animals (domestic and wildlife), environment, etc. and use it to select appropriate control and prevention strategies. Social, gender and behavioural factors should also be collected and used to tailor locally appropriate responses and risk communication.",booklet1,808
186,188,"Step 5 – Prepare: Preparedness refers to the availability of public health emergency preparedness and response plans, including stockpiling (vaccines, drugs and laboratory reagents), designation of isolation facilities, setting aside resources for outbreak response and training of relevant personnel. Take steps in advance of occurrence of outbreaks or public health events, to prepare teams that may respond quickly and set aside essential supplies and equipment which will be available for immediate action. Ensure that a mechanism for coordination of response measures is set even before an outbreak occurs. Establishing pre-positioned ‘outbreak response contracts’ and Memorandum of Understanding (MOUs) between UN agencies and NGOs/civil society helps logistical support to be sent to the lowest level quickly for action. Use historical data from human health and other relevant sectors (such as meteorological, animal, environment, etc.) to assess vulnerabilities and risks to the population. The risk analysis can also be conducted through prediction models. ",booklet1,1067
187,189,"Step 6 - Respond: When an outbreak, acute public health event or condition is detected, an investigation should take place to determine the cause of the problem, identify gaps and vulnerabilities, coordinate and mobilize resources and personnel to implement the appropriate public health response. The results of the investigation should guide the response. At National level, a Public Health Emergency Operations Centre (PHEOC) should be activated under the leadership of a government official with decision-making authority and at the district level a similar coordination mechanism for response. Identify a spokesperson and ensure a risk communication plan is in place and put a coordination platform for all stakeholders who are involved in communication. Meet with community political and religious leaders and elders to ensure adequate community engagement to get successful responses ",booklet1,891
188,190,"Step 7 – Risk communication: Risk communication is an essential element for all surveillance systems, as well as for disaster and emergency preparedness and response.  It is the real-time exchange of information, advice and opinions between experts, community leaders, or officials and the people who are at risk. Encourage future cooperation by communicating with all levels including communities that provided data, reported outbreaks, cases and events, about the investigation outcome and success of response efforts. Acknowledge the reporting by communities.",booklet1,562
189,191,"Step 8 – Monitor, evaluate, supervise and provide feedback to improve the surveillance system: Assess the effectiveness of the surveillance and response systems, in terms of timeliness, quality of information, preparedness, (thresholds, case management) and overall performance. Provide feedback to reinforce health workers’ efforts to participate in the surveillance system. Take action to correct problems and make improvements. Different evaluation procedures can be used such as After Action Review (AAR), Intra Action Review (IAR) Joint External Evaluation (JEE), Simulation Exercises (SIMEX), operational review etc. Community representatives, private sector NGOs, bilateral and multi-lateral should be included in these evaluation activities. ",booklet1,750
190,192,1.9.1 The different levels where surveillance activities are performed,booklet1,70
191,193,The levels in Malawi are defined as follows:,booklet1,44
192,194,"Community: Represented by basic community-level services such as trained birth attendants, community or village health agents, or similar care providers, village or community leaders (religious, traditional or political) or school teachers, health and agriculture extension workers, locally identified community-based surveillance volunteers, veterinarians, chemical sellers, and traditional healers.",booklet1,400
193,195,"Health facility: For surveillance purposes, all institutions (public, private, NGOs or others faith-based organizations) with outpatient and/or in-patient facilities are defined as a “health facility.”",booklet1,201
194,196,"Point of Entry; For surveillance purposes, these include all ground crossings, airports and ports implementing public health measures for incoming and outgoing travellers. Reports to district level but also has the mandate to notify the national level.",booklet1,252
195,197,District: Secondary level of health service delivery that implements policies made at national level. This level reports to the national level.,booklet1,143
196,198,"National level: This is the central level where policies are set and resources are allocated. In relation to surveillance, this level reports on priority diseases and uses the IHR decision instrument in Section 2 to report public health events of international concern to WHO.",booklet1,276
197,199,"In an integrated system, some laboratory services are available at each level described above. A description of laboratory functions by level is in Section 1.0. These guidelines focus on improving surveillance for all service delivery points (public and private). ",booklet1,264
198,200,1.9.2 How districts can strengthen surveillance and response,booklet1,60
199,201,Surveillance systems can be assessed using the standard protocol for evaluating the surveillance system developed by WHO-AFRO (Protocol for the Assessment of National Communicable Disease Surveillance and Response Systems WHO/CDS/CSR/ISR/2001.2). ,booklet1,247
200,202,"Districts can also use a matrix of IDSR functions and skills to describe their role in the surveillance system. Such a matrix describes a complete system in which all the skills and activities are in place. Each level supports activities at other levels and reinforces the opportunity for successful decision-making at corresponding levels and functions. In an IDSR system under development, the matrix provides a systematic framework for improving and strengthening the system.",booklet1,478
201,203,Practical uses of the IDSR matrix include:,booklet1,42

If one or more of the elements at each level is not present or is being performed poorly, the risk of failure for achieving surveillance and control objectives increases. An effective system will be supported at each level from the levels above and below. A complete system minimizes any delay in taking public health actions.",booklet1,463
209,211,"The functions of detection, reporting, analysis, investigation, response, risk communication, monitoring and evaluation and providing feedback are interdependent and should always be linked.

Others have used newly developed tools such as the JEE as a means of assessing country capacity to prevent, detect and respond to public health events. The assessment provides results that can be used to solve problems with resources, the quality and timeliness of surveillance data, and how the information is used. The national strategic plan could also be used as reference while preparing a district specific action plan.

399,401,The control or containment of known risks to public health is one of the most powerful ways to improve international public health security. The threat posed by known risks constitutes the vast majority of events with a potential to cause public health emergencies that fall within the scope of the International Health Regulations (2005). There are already existing control programmes which address infectious diseases as well as food and environmental safety and contribute significantly to WHO global alert and response system.,booklet1,530

428,430,Annex E: Guide for Establishing Community Based Surveillance and response,booklet1,73
429,431,"Community-Based Surveillance (CBS) is a simple, adaptable and low-cost public health initiative managed by communities in coordination with the formal surveillance structures. Communities and designated community focal points are trained and empowered to be aware of potential health risks including emerging events that might indicate a new health risk, close monitoring for notifiable and seasonal diseases or signs of an existing disease outbreak. An event that appears ‘unusual’ to the community might be to a health-trained professional an early warning sign of a more serious and larger health risk or public health event.",booklet1,628
430,432,Two different strategies of community-based surveillance can be used to collect community information;,booklet1,102
431,433,Community Event-Based Surveillance (CEBS) ,booklet1,42
432,434,"CEBS relies on reporting of unusual events and this is designed to rapidly identify whether something might be wrong in the community. Information may be incomplete, unconfirmed and may even be a rumour. The definition of an ‘unusual event’ will change from one community to another, and needs to be defined in each context. It can be one event, or a cluster of events, that may be unusual for a specific community or during a certain time of year. For example, an unusual event could be: “A cluster of deaths from an unknown cause in the same household or adjacent households”",booklet1,577
433,435,"Community-Indicator Based Surveillance (CIBS). This type of surveillance is used to identify/ report events based on agreed indicators (case definitions). Information from community can come from people who have already been oriented on the indicators and these include community volunteers, or any other representatives from community.",booklet1,336
434,436,"CIBS relies on reporting a suspected case or the trend of a specific disease(s) using a community case definition. A community case definition is two or three easily identified symptoms associated with a specific disease. It is a more basic form of syndromic (symptom) reporting that is used by health professional in national/IDSR and other disease surveillance systems. Examples include- Influenza (flu) community case definition: “sudden illness, fever, cough and difficulty breathing or new, floppy paralysis for AFP.",booklet1,521
435,437,"Both systems should be established to ensure all information from the community is captured and quickly reported to a designated surveillance focal person at the next level for follow up. Moreover, these two elements of surveillance should be integrated at the community level.",booklet1,277
436,438,Steps for establishing Community Based Surveillance (CBS) ,booklet1,58
437,439,A crucial step in establishing the Community Based Surveillance is to ensure there is a buy in of both the national and subnational level authorities. This will enable the CBS system to be recognized formally as part of the National Surveillance System and designated people will then be appointed. A designated health facility manager or surveillance officer responsible for coordinating CBS activities should therefore: ,booklet1,422
438,440,Determine within the facility the availability and knowledge of standard community case definitions for reporting suspected priority diseases and conditions and events of public health concern. ,booklet1,194
439,441,"Sensitize community leaders, elders and other influencers about the need for CBS, what information is needed, how the information will be used, the process that is being proposed, the characteristics of a successful VHCs, the financial or human resource support being offered by the district and what the community gains by participating.",booklet1,338
440,442,"Define the sources of information about health events in the community, including points of contact that the community has with health services. A key informant selected from these sources can form community networks that support the VHCs in early detection of alerts; for example, sensitizing the women and men that often visit the grain milling or tea drinking places. The sources of information include:",booklet1,406
441,443,"Home Visits: whereby VHCs are expected to visit all homes in their catchment area regularly to inquire about the priority diseases, any deaths that might have occurred since last visit to the home.",booklet1,197
442,444,"Gathering Places: Another way to pick up information on priority events will be for Community health workers to frequently go to village gathering/meeting places. This will not serve as a substitute to the home visits, but rather another approach to ensure that all priority events are identified in good time. Gathering of meeting places in the community are those places where people gather to talk and share news by word-of-mouth. Examples include Community wells, pumps or rivers. In some communities, women gather every day at wells, pumps or rivers to collect drinking water or to wash clothes. While they work, women exchange news about their families and neighbourhood. ",booklet1,678
443,445,"Grain milling or grain pounding places: In some communities, women gather every day in the same place to mill, grind or pound grains into flour. Women often exchange news about their families and the neighbourhood as they work. ",booklet1,228
444,446,"Bottle stores or tea drinking places: In some communities, men gather every day in the same places to drink and socialize. These places may be ― bottle shops or other drinking places, in someone’s home or shop, or in the shade under a special tree. As they drink, the men sometimes tell each other the news about their families, friends and neighbours. ",booklet1,353
445,447,"At the market: A lot of information and news is exchanged at the market. When people go there, they spend some of their time buying or selling things and the rest of their time talking to friends, and neighbours. ",booklet1,213
446,448,"At churches, mosques or temples: Sometimes religious leaders make announcements before or after the service to let people know about things that are happening in the neighbourhood. Also, people who attend church or mosque often talk together before or after the service to exchange news about their families, friends and neighbours. ",booklet1,333
447,449,At the home of the village chief or the place where the village elders meet: The village chief and elders are usually kept informed about things that happen in their community. They often gather to talk about community news or to discuss problems and make decisions. ,booklet1,267
448,450,At schools and in school yards: Teachers and pupils often share information and news about their families and friends when they see each other at school or when they play in the school yard.,booklet1,190
449,451,"Identify Community key informants (CHW) for each source of information in collaboration with the community. Identify and specify the opportunities for community involvement in surveillance of health events and the role of the VHCs. the volunteers should be people who are trusted by the community, committed to ‘zero-case’ reporting, and they should be reassured that reporting bad news won’t get them into trouble, hence no need to falsify data ",booklet1,446
450,452,"Specify the alerts, events, diseases and conditions for surveillance within the catchment area and those directed by national policy and specify the trigger mechanisms. ",booklet1,169

454,456,"Train VHCs in surveillance and response skills as well as improved Interpersonal skills, using interactive training, adult learning techniques and role playing. Use of cell-phone based opportunities to play MP3s or other video clips can be helpful during training and in the community. ",booklet1,286
455,457,"Describe how communication about surveillance and response takes place and will be tracked between the health facility IDSR focal person and the VHCs. For literate VHCs, design simple alert forms (See Annex 2C) and show them how to fill information and those who are non-literate develop mechanisms of capturing information of events from them. Think of mechanisms like identifying someone from the family member who can assist with actual writing.",booklet1,448
456,458,"Include methods such as monthly meetings, telephone calls and so on to ensure tracking of VHCs. ",booklet1,96
457,459,Review and update procedures and methods of supportive supervision and feedback between the health facility and the community health workers and community key informants. Regular refresher trainings should also occur to ensure that community health workers and community key informants understand what and how alerts should be reported.,booklet1,336

The framework should be supported by a trained facility or dedicated district staff and should be regularly evaluated. ",booklet1,451
464,466,Community representatives that can be members of CBS team ,booklet1,58
465,467,"Any community member acceptable by the community can be VHC. They should be selected by the communities they live in so as to increase empowerment and ownership of CBS. Representation could be from basic village-level services such as community health volunteers, community health workers, trained birth attendants, community or village health agents, or similar care providers, village leaders (religious, traditional or political), school teachers, veterinarians, health extension workers, chemical sellers, and traditional healers and in other communities, a respected non-health person such as the barber, shop keeper or  who regularly talks to community members are effective focal points.  ",booklet1,696
466,468,"Once selected, the VHCs should receive training and carry out their role on how to recognize certain diseases or health conditions for the purpose of reporting suspect cases. ",booklet1,175
467,469,CBS Supervision ,booklet1,16
468,470,"The goal of supervision is to improve timeliness of reporting, fine-tune understanding of case definitions, and improve interpersonal communication skills. It is important that supervision is done with evidenced-based approaches so as to know what to improve in the surveillance.  All activities for implementation by CBS should be coordinated by a surveillance officer or health facility manager in his or her locality. He or she will: ",booklet1,437
469,471,"prepare a list of priority diseases, event or conditions for inclusion in the CBS based on the adapted IDSR technical guidelines; ",booklet1,130

475,477,"establish feedback loops, which is a critical action for ensuring that CBS continues to work. Ensure that constructive feedback and supportive supervision is done where they are credited and praised for the good job done and pinpoint areas for improvement.",booklet1,256
476,478,"disseminate simplified case definitions and alerts using posters or any other latest intervention methods (banners, leaflets, etc. that have been shown to work in that area) to relevant places within the community, as appropriate; ",booklet1,231
477,479,"monitor surveillance and response activities, including timeliness and completeness of reporting; ",booklet1,98
478,480,"supervise activities of the VHCs including the fine tune understanding of the case definitions. In case, VHCs are used for contact tracing, ensure the facility based person leads the process in collaboration with the health facility based person. ",booklet1,247

480,482,provide regular and timely feedback to CBS teams and ensure a two-way process for feedback to build trust between the CBS and the health facility person.,booklet1,153
481,483,"NB: In some countries, VHCs may be many in numbers and coordination might pose a challenge. A district may then appoint a CBS Focal Supervisor in a particular community (she/he might be among the CBS FPs) to oversee a specific a number of VHCs. Clear roles of the Community supervisor should be well stipulated so that they should not be the ones deciding if something is a health risk based only on notification Sources of information for CBS",booklet1,443
482,484,A functioning CBS should establish relationships with key sources of information. This includes but is not limited to the following sources of information: ,booklet1,156
483,485,"All community based health workers, VHCs, including traditional birth attendants, school teachers, pharmacists, who have trusted relationships with the local community. They are often located in remote areas where access to primary health care is scarce. Families often share information with a trusted, known health worker.",booklet1,324
484,486,"Community, traditional, youth or religious leaders and civil society: these individuals and groups may provide informal reports of unusual health events or health risks that they witness in their communities. ",booklet1,209
485,487,"Media: local, national and international media are important sources of information for CBS. Events such as clusters of human cases, outbreaks or unexpected and unusual deaths may be covered by local newspapers (printed or available through the Internet) or radio reports before they are detected and reported by local health services. ",booklet1,336
486,488,"Traditional medicine practitioners and healers and shrine keepers. In some African countries, a large number of the population depends on traditional medicine for primary health care.

142,144,FOREWORD,booklet3,8
143,145,"In 1998, the World Health Organization (WHO) Regional Office for Africa (AFRO) together with technical partners adopted a strategy for developing and implementing comprehensive public health surveillance and response systems in African countries, initially called integrated disease surveillance (IDS). However, to highlight the linkage between surveillance and response, the strategy was later re-named Integrated Disease Surveillance and Response (IDSR). Malawi adopted the first edition of the IDSR technical guidelines in 2005. Since then, there has been an investment in human and material resources to strengthen capacities for public health surveillance systems in order to prevent, timely detect, and respond appropriately to public health threats. ",booklet3,757
144,146,"The coming into force, in 2007, of the International Health Regulations (IHR 2005), the emergence of new diseases, conditions and events and the formulation of strategies for disaster risk management (DRM) resulted in the need to revise the first edition of the IDSR technical guidelines. There was also the need to address the increasing burden of non-communicable diseases. Furthermore, there was the need to strengthen community-based surveillance for early detection, rapid confirmation and response to public health threats. Moreover, alignment with broader system strengthening objectives was required. Hence, in 2010, the second edition of the IDSR guidelines was developed, which Malawi adopted in 2014.",booklet3,711
145,147,"Diseases, both communicable and non-communicable, continue to be a major cause of morbidity and mortality in Malawi and in the Africa region as a whole despite the advanced global knowledge on how to detect and control them. Of late, non-communicable diseases are increasingly becoming a major public health problem in the country. The majority of non-communicable diseases are preventable but multiple factors which include environmental, social, and economic determinants hamper effective prevention and control of these diseases. As one way of addressing these problems, the Ministry of Health is strengthening the disease surveillance systems using new guidelines for the IDSR revised by the WHO-AFRO in 2018.",booklet3,713
146,148,"This Third Edition has now been reviewed to include the new developments. The manual contains practical guidelines for use as a general reference for surveillance activities at all levels; and as a resource material for developing training, supervision and evaluation of surveillance activities.",booklet3,295
147,149,"It is worth noting that, many public health events (PHEs) and emergencies and their associated risk factors could be prevented or their effects mitigated. However, the health systems in most countries remain inadequate.  To avert and mitigate the effects of future health security risks and emergencies, Malawi intends to implement these IDSR technical guidelines.  These guidelines recommend thresholds for action for priority diseases, conditions, public health events and responding to alerts. Using these action thresholds can be lifesaving.",booklet3,545
148,150,"Finally, I appeal to you all to ensure that the third edition of the IDSR technical guidelines are implemented within a broader context of health system strengthening; better coordination between human and animal health surveillance and other sectors involved in One Health approach; improved use of laboratory network capacity in surveillance and response; and better community engagement in public health interventions.

174,176,4.0 Investigate and confirm suspected outbreaks and other public health events,booklet3,78
175,177,"This section describes what needs to be done when conducting an outbreak investigation. An outbreak is defined as an increase in the number of cases of a disease or an event above what is normally expected in that population in a given area over a particular period of time. When an outbreak or any public health event or condition is detected and notified, there are several steps which are required for an outbreak investigation (see figure 4.1). These steps are usually listed in order, but their order of implementation is often non-sequential. Knowing these steps prepares one to conduct an investigation properly, using common sense and logic to determine when, how often, and to what extent the different steps should be implemented in a real investigation. These steps can also be used to investigate other public health problems in the district such as when an increase in chronic or non-communicable disease is detected. ",booklet3,931
176,178,The results of an investigation of an outbreak or other public health event leads to identification and assessment of people who have been exposed to an infectious disease or affected by an unusual health event. The investigation provides relevant information to use for taking immediate action and improving longer-term disease prevention activities.,booklet3,351
177,179,The purpose of an investigation is to:,booklet3,38
178,180,Verify the outbreak or the public health event and risk.,booklet3,56
179,181,Identify and treat additional cases that have not been reported or recognized.,booklet3,78
180,182,Collect information and laboratory specimens for confirming the diagnosis.,booklet3,74
181,183,Identify the source of infection or cause of the outbreak.,booklet3,58
182,184,"Describe the epidemiological situation in time, place and person",booklet3,64
183,185,Describe how the disease is transmitted and the populations at risk,booklet3,67
184,186,Select appropriate response activities to control the outbreak or the public health event,booklet3,89
185,187,Strengthen prevention activities to avoid future reoccurrence of the outbreak. ,booklet3,79
186,188,"Decide to investigate a reported outbreak, or public health event ",booklet3,66
187,189,The districts have the overall responsibility for investigating outbreaks and public health events. The national level provides technical support and policy guidance. This guideline also applies to health facility level.,booklet3,220
188,190,"For some communicable diseases, a single suspected case is the trigger for taking action, reporting the case to a higher level, and conducting an investigation. This is because these are dangerous diseases with either the potential for rapid transmission or high case fatality rates if cases are not treated promptly. For other diseases, the trigger is when cases reach a defined threshold (e.g. a particular number of cases per 100,000 population) in a defined community, geographical area or season. Sometimes an appearance of a single case of a communicable disease which has been absent from a population for a long period, or caused by an agent (e.g. bacterium or virus) not previously recognized in that community or area, or the emergence of a previously unknown disease or event, may also constitute an outbreak and should be reported and investigated.",booklet3,860
189,191,Health staff should promptly investigate the problem and respond to the immediate cases. Preparations for taking a wider public health response should also be made. Alert and epidemic thresholds are also described in Section 11.0 of these 3rd Edition Malawi IDSR Technical Guidelines in detail. ,booklet3,295
190,192,"NOTE: The threshold for some diseases will not change between districts or health facilities because the thresholds trigger immediate notification, and are set by national policy",booklet3,178
191,193,"Still, some urgent health events require investigations to be started immediately. Regardless, districts should aim to investigate suspected outbreaks and events within 48 hours of notification from lower level.",booklet3,211
192,194,Conduct an investigation when:,booklet3,30
193,195,The district receives a report of a suspected outbreak due to a disease that is targeted for immediate notification,booklet3,115
194,196,An unusual increase is seen in the number of cases or deaths during routine analysis of data,booklet3,92
195,197,Alert or epidemic thresholds have been reached for specific priority diseases. The initial trigger for a new epidemic prone disease could be the laboratory,booklet3,155
196,198,Communities or social media report rumours of deaths or a large number of cases that are not being seen in the health facility,booklet3,126
197,199,"A cluster of illnesses or deaths occurs for which the cause is not explained or is unusual (for example, an adult death due to bloody diarrhoea, cluster of illness among health care workers, cluster of animal (domestic and/or wildlife) deaths e.g. birds die offs due to avian influenza, livestock deaths due to anthrax, unusual abortion events in livestock)",booklet3,357
198,200,(ii)  Verify the reported information,booklet3,37
199,201,"Investigating outbreaks requires human, logistic and financial resources. When a suspected outbreak or event is reported, promptly verify that the information is accurate and reflects conditions suggesting a true outbreak or event. This will help to ensure that resources are used effectively. To verify the information, consider the following factors:",booklet3,352
200,202,"Source of information (for example, is the source of the rumour reliable? Is the report from a health facility or a community or social media?)",booklet3,143
201,203,Severity of the reported illness and use of standard case definition for reporting,booklet3,82

207,209,Available resources.,booklet3,20
208,210,Is it of national or international concern?,booklet3,43
209,211,"After taking the above factors into consideration, the situation may require a more urgent response than might otherwise have occurred. For example, reports of a suspected viral haemorrhagic fever case are treated with more urgency than reports of a less virulent disease because of the potential for high rates of death and rapid transmission.",booklet3,344
210,212,"Regardless of the factors, all suspected outbreaks or events (including immediately notifiable diseases or events) reported from health facilities need to be reported to the next level within 24 hours.",booklet3,201
211,213,"(iii) Record reported outbreaks, public health events and alerts",booklet3,64
212,214,"Prepare a method for tracking the reporting of suspected outbreaks, events and rumours to the district/national level. The purpose for tracking reported outbreaks is to ensure that the report of each suspected outbreak, public health event or alert is followed by some action and resolution. Keeping this record will help to gather information for evaluating the timeliness and completeness of the outbreak investigation and response process.",booklet3,442

In section 11.0 of these 3rd Edition Malawi IDSR Technical Guidelines, a list of standard case definitions for most IDSR priority diseases is already available. Even in situations where a case definition might be available, in specific outbreaks, other details are necessary to be included in the case definitions and these include geographical location, attendance at an event or travel to a certain location. In some circumstances, you might encounter a new disease not listed in the Section 11.0 of these 3rd Edition Malawi IDSR Technical Guidelines and you will need to develop an operational case definition. The common elements of a case definition include information on symptoms, date of onset of symptoms, laboratory results, and the essential elements of person, place, and time.",booklet3,947

Also talk to other informants in the community such as chemical sellers, school teachers, veterinarians (to know about the animal health situation), farmers, and community leaders.",booklet3,366
306,308,"The areas for the search may be influenced by the disease, its mode of transmission, and factors of risk related to time, place and person. Visit those places and talk to people who had, or were likely to have had, contact with the patient. Ask if they or anyone they know has had an illness or condition like the one being investigated. Find out if anyone else in the area around the case has been ill with signs or symptoms that meet the case definition. Find out if there were any recent deaths. If they say yes, find out what were the signs and symptoms of the person(s) that died. Enquire about the people that took care of these people when they were sick and also the preparation of the dead before and during the burial ceremony. Collect information that will help to describe the magnitude and geographic extent of the outbreak.",booklet3,837

321,323,"During the initial analysis, summarize the outbreak or events and look for clues about where the outbreak or event is occurring, how it is spreading, the source of the outbreak (from a single source, for example (a well or a funeral), and the persons at risk of becoming ill (for example, young children, refugees, person living in rural areas, and so on).  Present the data, taking into account time, place and person analysis (refer to Section 3) in the following way:",booklet3,470
322,324,Draw a histogram representing the course of the disease (an “Epi” curve).,booklet3,73

326,328,"In outbreak situation, apart from Case fatality rates, you may also wish to calculate attack rates. See section 3, on how to calculate the Attack rate.",booklet3,151
327,329,4.5.1 Interpret analysis results,booklet3,32
328,330,Review the analysis results while identifying potential risk factors for an outbreak. For example:,booklet3,98
329,331,What was the causal agent of the outbreak?,booklet3,42
330,332,What was the source of infection?,booklet3,33
331,333,What was the transmission pattern?,booklet3,34
332,334,What control measures were implemented and to what effect?,booklet3,58
333,335,(i) Interpret the time analysis results,booklet3,39
334,336,"Look at the histogram and observe the shape of the epidemic curve. Draw conclusions about when exposure to the agent that caused the illness occurred, the source of infection and related incubation period.",booklet3,205
335,337,"If the shape of the curve suddenly increases to develop a steep up-slope, and then descends just as rapidly, exposure to the causal agent was probably over a brief period of time. There may be a common source of infection.",booklet3,222
336,338,"If the shape of the epidemic curve is a plateau rather than a sharp peak, exposure to the common source is more likely to be over a long period of time.",booklet3,152
337,339,"If the curve presents as a series of progressively taller peaks separated by periods of incubation, the illness resulted from person-to-person transmission.",booklet3,156
338,340,Below are some of the examples of the shapes of epidemic curves and possible interpretation:,booklet3,92

345,347,"Depending on the organism that has contributed to this outbreak, specify the proximity of the cases to likely sources of infection.",booklet3,131
346,348,(iii) Interpret the person analysis results,booklet3,43
347,349,"Information developed from the person analysis is essential for planning the outbreak response because it describes more precisely the high-risk group(s) for transmission of this disease or condition. For example, if yellow fever cases occurred in patients less than 15 years of age, then the immunization response might need to target children less than 15 years of age.",booklet3,371

362,364,4.6 Report writing and dissemination of findings,booklet3,48
363,365,"All reports (Preliminary, Interim and final) should always be disseminated, even if no conclusive risk factors have been identified for a given outbreak. Prepare also situation reports (SitReps) of the given outbreak and share with relevant stakeholders. Section 7, describes various channels of communication during outbreak.",booklet3,326

368,370,Measures already initiated to contain the outbreak.,booklet3,51
369,371,"Recommendations: For controlling the situation further investigation/studies may be recommended. The district rapid response team should then immediately prepare an outbreak investigation report. This detailed report of the outbreak investigation should be prepared and disseminated immediately to the health facility where the outbreak occurred, district, national and also WHO. ",booklet3,380
370,372,A suggested outline for writing an investigation report is described in Annex 7D of Section 7.,booklet3,94
371,373,"To understand the spread of the disease you should draw a transmission tree starting with the index case. Moreover, the transmission tree assists in understanding the relative contributions of different settings to the spread of the disease in the given geographical area and hence regulates the infection transmission and the control measures. Reconstruction of a transmission chain or tree can be done provided the information is obtained from line list, and also a review of the timeline of dates of illness or contact with other cases, field investigations, and rapid risk assessment. The transmission tree is important as it assists in documenting the routes of transmission in a given geographical area and hence enables planned interventions. ",booklet3,750
372,374,The tree needs to be updated frequently and if a new cluster of cases starts in any part of the district try to ask questions to establish an epidemiological link (See Annex 4J for an example of how to draw a transmission tree).,booklet3,228
373,375,4.7 Implement prevention and control measures,booklet3,45
374,376,"Once an outbreak is identified, control measures are important for interrupting disease transmission and or limiting exposure to the source of infection and preventing occurrence of future outbreaks. If a pathogen or other suspected source of the outbreak is identified, control measures should target specific agents, sources, or reservoirs of infection. Section 11.0 of these 3rd Edition Malawi IDSR Technical Guidelines gives a description of some of the control measures for each priority diseases and references for further reading.",booklet3,537
375,377,Note: ,booklet3,6
376,378,"Control measures should be implemented at the first available point in the investigation and should occur concurrently with other investigation steps. Often, non-specific control measures can be put into place regardless of the type of disease or source. ",booklet3,255
377,379,"Ensure multi-sectoral engagement throughout response i.e. from community level to other non-health stakeholders who might be key for the particular outbreaks. Examples if you want to enforce by law, you might need assistance from the ministry responsible for security. ",booklet3,269
378,380,"At some point, during the outbreak setting, public health response might include also testing new potential countermeasures including vaccines and therapeutics. Thus, the conduct of biomedical research can be an important and discrete component of the response. Public health efforts must always remain at the forefront of the overall outbreak response. The research must be conducted in a scientifically and ethically sound manner to reach definitive conclusions about efficacy and safety as expeditiously as possible. It is the role of the National Level to liaise with the Ethical Committees Body within the country to provide a useful guide for analogous principles in outbreak situations in such settings ",booklet3,710
379,381,4.8 Conduct an assessment to determine if the event is a potential Public Health Emergency    of International Concern (PHEIC) ,booklet3,127
380,382,Risk assessment should be initiated as soon as possible by the designated investigation team to address the following questions:,booklet3,128

476,478,"Case 3 was a 40-year-old female nurse in the ICU at Neno District Hospital whose illness was laboratory-confirmed after her death. Her symptoms began on 2 April 2012, and she was admitted to Neno District Hospital ICU after developing pneumonia 7 days later. She was later transferred to ICU at Queen Elizabeth Central Hospital where she died on 19 April. During her illness, she was in close contact with 4 household members, including another brother who fell ill 10-days post exposure (case 9), and three others that were not affected. One month prior to her illness, her sister visited from Saudi Arabia (3). ",booklet3,613
477,479,Case 4 was a 65-year-old male doctor whose symptoms of fever and fatigue started 2 April 2012 and developed into pneumonia. The doctor opted to stay home during his illness and soon recovered. He did not travel or have contact with animals in the 10-days prior to his illness. His household members did not report any illness (3). ,booklet3,331

501,503,5.0 Prepare to respond to outbreaks and other public health events,booklet3,66
502,504,Rapid and effective response to a public health emergency such as a suspected outbreak or other public health event not only calls for an immediate response but is also one of the core capacities required by International Health Regulations 2005. Being prepared to detect and respond to such an event is an essential role of the district and national levels. ,booklet3,359
503,505,Preparations to respond to outbreaks and other public health events include: ,booklet3,77
504,506,Establishment of the Public Health Emergency Management Committee (PHEMC),booklet3,73
505,507,"Development of functional Public Health Emergency Operating Centres (PHEOC), that will act as a command and control centre for coordination of public health emergencies or events/incidents at National level, or a similar coordination structure and also at district levels. ",booklet3,273

507,509,Training key members of PHEMC and Public Health Emergency Rapid Response Teams (PHERRT),booklet3,87
508,510,"In addition, having a public health emergency preparedness and response plan (PHEPRP) is crucial. The PHEPRP should include the layout of the coordinating structure, the mapping of risks and how to address and maintain the emergency response plan for relevant events, including the capacity to support operations at primary response level during a public health emergency. The EPR is the overarching plan and should be complemented by a PHEOC plan and event or incident specific plans (ISP). The PHEOC plan guides the operations of the command and coordination centre, outlining standard operating procedures of how each functional area operate and work together; and the ISP is a plan developed to address high priority emergency event based on risk analysis and is always annexed to the EPR plan. ",booklet3,799
509,511,5.1 Establish a permanent public health emergency operations centre (command and control centre) for overseeing public health emergency preparedness and response activities,booklet3,172
510,512,"Response to Public Health events is successful if there is a more, coherent, effective and efficient coordination of various actors representing a multi-sectoral team in the context of one heath. This will also ultimately result in minimising the impact of the event in the community. The International Health Regulations (IHR 2005) requires that State Parties develop, strengthen and maintain their capacity to respond promptly and effectively to public health risks and public health emergencies. ",booklet3,499
511,513,Malawi has PHEOC that acts as a command and control centre to enhance coordination and oversees public health emergency preparedness and response activities. ,booklet3,158
512,514,The PHEOC will need to have the following essential elements to be fully functional to support preparation and response to emergencies:,booklet3,135
513,515,Plans and procedures for operations,booklet3,35
514,516,Telecommunication technology and infrastructure to enable timely communication,booklet3,78
515,517,Information system to support informed decision making,booklet3,54
516,518,Trained human resource. ,booklet3,24
517,519,"The PHEOC monitors events using various sources of data; facilitates and improves communication between public health and emergency management personnel, and facilitates coordination with multiple response partners. The PHEOC feeds into the National Disaster Risk Management EOC to manage escalated events of national magnitude. It is highly recommended that the PHEOC is positioned at the national and district levels where there are already structures mandating the coordination for public health emergencies. At national level, the PHEOC is placed at PHIM which is answerable to the Secretary for Health.  At district level, it is located at the office of the DHSS who is answerable to the District Commissioner.",booklet3,715
518,520,"During public health emergencies, the PHEOC, which is the command and control centre, guided by the National PHEMC is activated and functions as a centre for decision-making, and coordination of information and resources for strategic management of public health events and emergencies. The PHEOC uses the Incident Management System (IMS), which is a standardized approach used to manage and coordinate the response by providing a common hierarchy for response by staff. In the context of IDSR, the IMS is represented by Public Health Emergency Management Committee (PHEMC) at strategic level, which will assemble during activation of PHEOC; as well as the National Public Health Emergency Management subcommittees. The IMS outlines the specific roles and responsibilities of responders during an event, while providing a common framework for government, the private sector, and non-governmental organizations to work seamlessly together. In IMS, each person is assigned a specific role and follows a set command structure. It can be staffed with additional teams of subject matter experts, analysts, logisticians, and support staff depending on the situation at that particular time. The operational structure of PHEOC (Command and Control centre) can also be scaled up, which is essential for maintaining the effectiveness of a PHEOC and it can be modular (i.e. can be partially or fully activated) according to situational needs. (Please refer to WHO Framework for a Public Health Emergency Operation Centre)",booklet3,1511
519,521,"Most importantly, IMS should be functional at all levels of the health system delivery (national, district and health facilities). It is important once the IMS is activated during public health emergencies, the PHEMC regularly meet (at least daily or weekly) to facilitate coordination, communication and information sharing and put in place containment measures and at the same time facilitate the deployment of the PHERRT.  During activation, the PHEOC will also help in the flow of information horizontally and vertically to the respective departments, relevant sectors and partners for smoother relief operations. ",booklet3,618
520,522,"Having a centre for command and control is essential for preparedness and response to public health events. If resources allow, districts will need to have PHEOCs, with basic facilities that support direct coordination of preparedness and response to public health emergencies and facilitate real time communication and information between various stakeholders at their levels, but also ensuring there is a mechanism of sharing information with the national level PHEOC. At district level, the PHERRT performs the roles of PHEOC.  ",booklet3,531
521,523,"When inactive, the PHEOC (Command and Control centre), usually reduces in size, respective members under various Public Health Emergency Response Management Subcommittees return to respective working stations. The few staff remaining at the centre will then liaise with respective sections or departments to continue with maintaining plans and procedures, conducting trainings and simulation exercises, routine and event based surveillance activities, as well as maintaining systematic database of the resources available, important phone numbers, names and addresses of important government and non-government officials, international bodies and NGOs.",booklet3,652
522,524,5.2 Establish a national and district public health emergency management committee (PHEMC),booklet3,90
523,525,Public health emergency management committee (PHEMC) should be established at both levels; national and district. The PHEMC across all levels should work closely with their counterparts to plan and monitor the implementation of public health emergency plans. These are the coordinating committees in their respective levels and are composed of technical and non-technical members from health and other sectors. The role of the PHEMC is to develop and oversee the implementation of emergency preparedness and response plan. ,booklet3,523
524,526,"The PHEMC can also be known as a policy group. At national level, the PHEMC will provide policy direction in the implementation and operation of the national PHEOC and will also provide an oversight, policy and strategic guidance in the implementation of functional PHEOCs or similar coordination structures or mechanism at district level. ",booklet3,340
525,527,"The PHEMC will also mobilise funds for PHEOC development and sustainability. The PHEMC will provide oversight for PHEOC operations and, in the absence of pre-established mutual aid arrangements with other jurisdictions, it may also be the authority that handles requests for external material or financial assistance, particularly in complex, multi-sectoral or multijurisdictional emergencies.",booklet3,393

This includes mapping and assessing risks (in the catchment area) with the potential to affect community health. This mapping must address all acute health risks, and not be restricted to communicable diseases. The exercise should consider the identification and mapping across all levels from national through district to health facilities. For example, include evaluation of drinking water sources or food storage methods and animal breeding areas and movements.",booklet3,671

642,644,"Outbreaks and other public health emergencies require the rapid mobilization of resources such as vaccines, medicines and lab supplies. It is prudent to map out resources available so as to get the status of the stockpile with respect to pharmaceuticals, Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) and other equipment to establish and preposition stockpiles of materials before an emergency occurs. While doing the mapping at national level for stockpiling, it is also important to know the global stockpile of various items which can be tapped into during an outbreak. ",booklet3,563
643,645,"As follow up to the public health risk assessment activity, each level from districts to national level should set up a contingency stock of medicines, vaccines, reagents and supplies to permit prompt management of the first cases without delay. For district level, this is critical before support arrives from higher levels. Ensure that, there are also quick mechanisms of sending supplies from central level. Also, regularly and carefully monitor the contingency stock in order to avoid shortages and expiry of medicines, vaccines, reagents and supplies. Examples of stock management tools are included in the Annex 5A at the end of this section. The content of the contingency stock varies with the nature of epidemic-prone diseases and the risk of outbreak in the district. Risk assessment activities help to develop a list of minimum materials that should be stockpiled at the district and community levels.  If not, all districts and community levels can be stockpiled with minimum materials, ensure a designated point (health centre, district) is identified to ensure quick release of these items when needed during an outbreak.

703,705,"The goal of an integrated disease surveillance and response is to use data for public health response or action. This section describes steps for declaring an outbreak and activating the response structures, conducting a public health response and providing general directions for immediate response actions for leading causes of illness, death and disability. Consult relevant WHO guidelines which are at the end of this section, for responding to chemical, biological and radio-nuclear events. ",booklet3,496
704,706,"When an outbreak, acute public health event or condition is detected, an investigation should take place to determine the cause of the outbreak as described in Section 4. The results of the investigation should guide the response. Most disease prevention and control programs implement successful response actions such as conducting a mass immunization campaign for a vaccine-preventable disease, strengthening nutritional support and feeding practices for children with malnutrition, or administering anti-malarial, antibiotic or antiviral treatments as indicated. Successful responses are carried out with community involvement and often include social and behaviour change component. ",booklet3,687
705,707,"Effective coordination of response activities is also critical, as many actors/stakeholders will be involved. It is essential that all actors/stakeholders be identified in advance including their areas of support, roles and responsibilities to enable smooth response during an epidemic or any other public health event. This is the role of the PHEMC, which through the activation of the PHEOC, they will ensure effective coordination of the response activities across different sectors and donors (as discussed in Section 5).",booklet3,525

709,711,"Once an epidemic threshold is reached at district level, the Director of Health and Social Services should notify the Public Health Institute of Malawi (PHIM). Depending on the event, at the national level, the PHIM, and the IHR NFP will assess whether the event is a potential Public Health Event of International Concern (PHEIC) using the International Health Regulations (IHR) decision instrument. The NFP through the director of PHIM will report to the Secretary for Health to notify the WHO IHR AFRO Office. They will then alert the nearby districts about the outbreak for coordinated response efforts. While waiting for confirmation of laboratory diagnosis there may be a declaration of an outbreak by the Minister of Health or respective sector ministry",booklet3,760

1380,1382,Establish CTC + several Oral Rehydration Points (ORPs),booklet3,54
1381,1383,"Ideally, the CTC should be located inside the existing hospital premises but clearly separated and isolated from the other departments to avoid spread of infection to non-cholera patients. If the hospital premises are not suitable, another site must be found. In urban/camp settings, It is preferable to have one single CTC and several ORPs rather than setting up multiple CTCs, thereby increasing potential sources of infection. When affected areas are too far from the CTC, access can become a problem. Ambulances can be provided for referral, or a CTU may be established as an intermediate structure. Use of taxis/buses should be discouraged given the high contamination risk during the journey.",booklet3,698
1382,1384,In rural settings: ,booklet3,19
1383,1385,Establish Cholera Treatment Units (CTU) ,booklet3,40
1384,1386,"The CTU should be located inside the health facility, or close to it. If this is not possible, other existing structures may be used. CTUs may paralyses routine health services as adequate case management is labour-intensive and other health services may suffer from staff shortage. In areas that are far from any treatment facility, it may be possible to decentralize the CTU to the level of the affected villages.",booklet3,415
1385,1387,Oral rehydration Points (ORPs),booklet3,30

1568,1570,SECTION 7:  RISK COMMUNICATION AND COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT,booklet3,55
1569,1571,7.0 Risk Communication   and Community engagement,booklet3,49
1570,1572,"Risk communication and community engagement is an essential element of disaster and emergency preparedness and response and is one of the core capacities in the International Health Regulations 2005 (IHR 2005). Risk communication is real time two-way exchange of information, perceptions and advice among risk assessors, risk managers, and various groups of people in the society about the likelihood and consequences of harm from the event (WHO, 2005). Its ultimate purpose is that everyone at risk is able to take informed decisions to mitigate the effects of the threat (hazard) such as a disease outbreak and take protective and preventive action. ",booklet3,652
1571,1573,"Risk communication uses a mix of communication and engagement strategies and tactics, including but not limited to, mass media communications, social media, mass awareness campaigns, health promotion, stakeholder engagement, social mobilization and community engagement. ",booklet3,271
1572,1574,"The current 21st century, has witnessed an exponential growth in travel, trade and migration, coupled with also communication technology revolution providing massive access to a variety of means of communication and information. The public and communities have been part of and exposed to a variety of dynamic, fast-changing, formal and informal media, social media and complex social networks that influence how risk is communicated, perceived and acted on. The latest evidence shows that the practice of risk communication is a complex task that is a core public health intervention in any response to disease outbreaks/epidemics, pandemics and other health emergencies (Communicating Risk in Public Health Emergencies: Geneva. World Health Organization 2017, License CC BY-NC-SA 3’ IGO). ",booklet3,791
1573,1575,"It is therefore important for risk communication to be conducted in order to promote the primary public health goal of rapid outbreak containment, preventing avoidable death and disease with the least possible disruption to economies and society. During epidemics and pandemics, humanitarian crises and natural disasters, effective risk communication allows people most at risk to understand and adopt protective behaviours. It allows authorities and experts to listen to and address people’s concerns and needs so that the advice they provide is relevant, trusted and acceptable.",booklet3,580
1574,1576,"This section describes how to conduct risk communication before, during and after an outbreak. Effective communication provides those at risk with the knowledge to make informed decisions for protective action when linked to functioning service. It also provides decision makers with summary information especially if there was an outbreak response, allowing them to review how resources were applied to contain the event.",booklet3,422
1575,1577,7.1 Risk Communication in the context of IDSR,booklet3,45
1576,1578,"IDSR strategy is an approach for improving public health surveillance and response for priority diseases, conditions and events at community, health facility, district and national levels. Since IDSR is a system with the potential to ensure a reliable supply of information to the national level in order to fulfil IHR requirements, risk communication should be integrated in all the IDSR core functions and activities particularly detection, sample collection, reporting, analysis and interpretation, feedback, response and preparedness. The IDSR core functions and activities for each level of the health system are well illustrated in the Introduction section of this guideline. Effective risk communication is therefore needed to achieve the objectives for IDSR ",booklet3,766
1577,1579,"If well planned and integrated in IDSR, risk communication can improve decision making and adoption of recommended behaviours by communities and contribute to the prevention, control and response to priority diseases and other public health events. Such communication needs to be carefully planned and implemented as well as properly integrated with emergency management activities and operations at community, district, and national levels to support all the relevant core IDSR functions and related activities at that level.

1578,1580,7.1.1 Benefits of Risk Communication,booklet3,36
1579,1581,"Risk communication improves decision making compliance with treatment and required behaviours for preventive actions, promotes transparency and accountability and builds trust with individuals, community leaders, health workers and policy makers. When risk communication is effectively carried out, it promotes the primary public health goal of rapid outbreak containment preventing avoidable death and disease and with the least possible disruption to economies and society. During epidemics and pandemics, and humanitarian crises and natural disasters, effective risk communication allows people most at risk to understand and adopt protective behaviours. It allows authorities and experts to listen to and address people’s concerns and needs so that the advice they provide is relevant, trusted and acceptable. It is critical that risk communication is not only targeted at outbreak response, risk communication plans should include activities before, during and after the outbreak",booklet3,984
1580,1582,"When the public is at risk of a real or potential health threat, direct interventions may take time to organize and resources may be few. Communicating advice and guidance, therefore, often stands as the first and most important public health tool in managing a risk. Pro-active risk communication encourages the public and service providers to adopt protective behaviours when they are linked to functioning systems and services. It facilitates heightened disease surveillance, reduces confusion, and minimizes miscommunication and falsehoods (rumours) in relation to the cause, transmission of a disease and proven effective protective actions. It allows for a better use of resources, all of which are necessary for an effective response (WHO, 2008).",booklet3,753
1581,1583,7.1.2 Target audiences for risk communication,booklet3,45

1696,1698,"Since risk communication is a complex activity involving different audiences, having an integrated approach in risk communication is very crucial. The key components for integrated emergency risk communication are indicated in Figure 1. This model allows for the successful design and implementation of an effective communication strategy. The model highlights the necessity of a collaborative approach between different target audiences across the board.",booklet3,455

1698,1700,Figure 1: An Integrated Model for emergency risk communication.,booklet3,63
1699,1701,7.2 Key inter-linked Principles for Effective Communication:,booklet3,60
1700,1702,There are 5 key principles for effective communication as outlined below:,booklet3,73
1701,1703,Creating and Maintaining Trust ,booklet3,31
1702,1704,"Building and maintaining trust is, arguably, the most important function of an effective communication during an outbreak or a public health event and should include: ",booklet3,167
1703,1705,"Timely, transparent information regarding the nature of the threat,  ",booklet3,69
1704,1706,The response to the event and ,booklet3,30
1705,1707,"Actionable advice on protective actions people can take, linked to functioning services to increase self-efficacy",booklet3,113
1706,1708,"This creates trust in the response, in the response teams and increases the likelihood that they follow the advice that is given. Trust is now considered the most important requirement for effective risk communication.",booklet3,218
1707,1709,"According to the latest evidence, risk communication in health emergencies should include ensuring genuine participation of the population taking into account three key elements: ",booklet3,179
1708,1710,"The understanding of that population’s specific context, concerns, beliefs, practices and traditions so as to shape scientific and logistic information, explanations that address community concerns (social science intelligence).",booklet3,228
1709,1711,"Provision of understandable and trusted advice that they are likely to follow to save lives and bring the outbreak under control in the shortest possible time, in their own languages adapted to their educational levels and preferences (i.e. oral or visual), on channels and through interlocutors (intermediators) of their choice, (translational communication), and   ",booklet3,367
1710,1712,Meaningful community engagement and the participation of (their) trusted interlocutors/messengers (means of dissemination),booklet3,122
1711,1713,"Trust is thus the currency for all public health interventions, and has, in an era of information overload, emerged as the critical element for effective risk communication (i.e. that the expert advice is acted on by key stakeholders and affected and at-risk populations). Risk communication should therefore aim at building, maintaining or restoring the trust of the public in those charged with the responsibility of managing the risk. The latest evidence highlights that to build trust, risk communication interventions should; ",booklet3,531
1712,1714,Be linked to functioning and accessible services.,booklet3,49
1713,1715,Be transparent and timely.,booklet3,26
1714,1716,"Be easy to understand for target populations (i.e. in their preferred oral or visual forms; and in their own languages or dialects, targeted to their educational levels and cultural references).",booklet3,194
1715,1717,"Acknowledge and communicate uncertainty (don’t over reassure, don’t speculate; but communicate frequently so that the evolution of an event and our understanding is transparent and not a cause of destroying trust). ",booklet3,215
1716,1718,"Link to self-efficacy (can people really do what you ask them, do they have the ability, equipment, services, education they need to adopt our advice?).",booklet3,152
1717,1719,"Be disseminated using multiple platforms, methods and channels. ",booklet3,64
1718,1720,"Identify, involve and collaborate with people that the community trusts in decision-making and not just in information dissemination. This ensures that interventions and the communication about them are contextually appropriate and community-owned. ",booklet3,249
1719,1721,Timely announcements and transparency: ,booklet3,39
1720,1722,"In most cases, public response to a health threat depends on the way the first and subsequent announcements are made. This necessitates announcing an event or threat as and when it emerges, even when the information is incomplete or changing fast.  This in turn implies that communicating uncertainty is a cornerstone of risk communication. Communication by authorities, response managers or front-line personnel must include;",booklet3,426
1721,1723,"Information about the uncertainties associated with the risk, event and interventions",booklet3,85
1722,1724,Indicate what is known and not known at a particular moment in time,booklet3,67
1723,1725,"A commitment, and follow up to keep people frequently informed and updated with the changing, uncertain situation",booklet3,113
1724,1726,"Multiple platforms, mechanisms and trusted interlocutors to ensure that consistent and coordinated information reaches stakeholders and the population ",booklet3,151
1725,1727,"Listening to, understanding and respecting public concerns",booklet3,58
1726,1728,"Understanding public perceptions, concerns, fears and expectations is as critical for risk communication as understanding the risky practices and behaviours that affect risk.  The understanding of communities must start before and during an emergency. There are many ways to better listen to community concerns and understand their contexts that influence if the advice for corrective or preventive practices given to them will actually be accepted and acted upon. These include Knowledge, Attitude, Practice (KAP) surveys or mini-surveys; community walk-throughs, focus group discussions, key informant interviews, getting feedback from stakeholders, social media and media monitoring, etc. A serious attempt must be made to execute health interventions and health advices, based on evidence gathered using these methods and other social science approaches.",booklet3,858
1727,1729,Advance Planning ,booklet3,17
1728,1730,"Risk communication is most effective when it is integrated with emergency preparedness, risk analysis and response (risk management). This means that a risk communication plan must be prepared during the preparedness stage. Emergency risk communication planning must occur in advance and be a continuous process with a focus on preparedness and prevention as well as response. Planning should be sensitive to stakeholders’ needs. It should be participatory, responsive to the context and incorporate feedback from affected groups. ",booklet3,531
1729,1731,"The International Health Regulations (IHR) requires all governments to build national capacity for detection, alert and response to public health emergencies. One of the core capacities is risk communication. Accordingly, risk communication planning should include:",booklet3,265
1730,1732,"The systems required (strategies, plans, SOPS, and mechanisms at national,  and district levels); ",booklet3,98
1731,1733,"The coordination of partners, sectors, stakeholders; ",booklet3,53
1732,1734,"Capacity for fast, effective public communication in languages and channels of the populations’ preference; ",booklet3,108
1733,1735,"The ability to track and quickly manage concerns, perceptions, rumours and misinformation; ",booklet3,91
1734,1736,Communication engagement with affected and at-risk communities. ,booklet3,64
1735,1737,Ensuring Equity: ,booklet3,17
1736,1738,"All citizens have a right to appropriate information about health risks, including what needs to be done in response to threats to their health. Unfortunately, large segments of society are excluded from routine communication about threats to health. Risk communication must therefore ensure equitable sharing of information to the public and avoid exclusion of marginalized members of society from health action. This means paying attention to the reach of communication, using trusted channels and interlocutors, not using jargon or technical language, use of peoples own languages and dialects, adapting messages to people’s levels of understanding and education; and ensuring that the actions promoted are those that people can realistically change. Special attention should be paid to analysing power dynamics in communities and taking special measures to reach those hardest to reach (women, minorities, the very old and young, people with disabilities, the poor, migrants and refugees, etc.). ",booklet3,1000
1737,1739,7.3 Create an enabling environment for effective communication to the populations at risk,booklet3,89
1738,1740,Establish risk communication systems and structure at the national and district levels. ,booklet3,88
1739,1741,"If not present, then establishing multi-sectoral communication committees/ structures across all levels i.e. National and District Levels (See Annex 7F for the examples of members of the communication subcommittee and roles). TORs can be expanded depending on the pre-outbreak, outbreak and post outbreak phase in line with each function. (See annex 7F for an expanded list of possible stakeholders).",booklet3,400

1755,1757,A big proportion of communication activities should be implemented in the pre-emergency phase for better preparedness. People managing communication activities should take advantage of the absence of an emergency to build the country’s communication capacity and develop communication plans and tools to bring the nation to a high level of communication preparedness. The pre-emergency phase should also be used to develop the necessary communication messages and materials and promote practice of behaviours that can prevent the risk. ,booklet3,536

1790,1792,"During an outbreak response, and when the public is at risk of a real or potential health threat, treatment options may be limited, direct interventions may take time to organize and resources may be few. Communicating advice and guidance, therefore, often stands as the most important public health tool in managing a risk. The focus of outbreak communication is to promote outbreak control and mitigate disruption to society by communicating with the public in ways that build, maintain or restore trust.",booklet3,506
1791,1793,"Pro-active communication encourages the public to adopt protective behaviours, facilitates heightened disease surveillance, reduces confusion and fear and allows for a better use of resources, all of which are necessary for an effective response. Pro/active communication also shows that health authorities are in control of the situation and care about the public and build trust between them and the community at large.",booklet3,421

By alerting a population and partners to an infectious disease risk, surveillance of potential cases increases, protective behaviours are adopted, confusion is limited and communication resources are more likely to be focused. Effective communication can help limit the spread of a disease and ultimately save lives. It also minimizes damage to societies and economies and can help communities recover faster from a health event or emergency.  ",booklet3,570

1798,1800,Outbreaks usually create fear in the community. Involvement of several different stakeholders sometimes leads to uncoordinated and duplication of effort. Provision of timely and accurate information through a well-coordinated mechanism is important. ,booklet3,250
1799,1801,"Internal coordination of communication among national stakeholders is key during an emergency.  The “Risk Communication and Social Mobilization Subcommittee” which has been described in Section 5, has the responsibility of ensuring that there is an internal communication system among national stakeholders to ensure information flows to different government sectors on time.",booklet3,375
1800,1802,"Partner coordination is another key element during an outbreak and event response and is aimed at fostering ownership, effective participation of key players and efficient use of resources. (See annex 7F for the potential partners and stakeholders who can be involved). It establishes routine communication structures among health workers, community and partners. It helps ensure that this vital link is available and functional during an emergency.

Thus, establishing routine communication structures and processes between the health and community partners helps to ensure that this vital link is available and functional during an emergency. Options for communicating between the various partners can range from press releases, press conferences, television and radio messages, meetings (health personnel, community, religious, opinion and political leaders); Educational and communication materials (posters, fliers); Multi-media presentations (for example, films, video or narrated slide presentations) at the markets, health centres, schools, women’s and other community groups, service organizations, religious centres, local community media, Social media (Facebook, Twitter, WhatsApp, etc.), SMS, telephone, hand-carried message, Community drama groups/play group; site visits; fax, email updates and exchanges of communication materials to more formal decision-making committees.

1834,1836,"The media is a major influence and should be seen as a partner in risk communication. However, the media is often associated with political parties or private interests and can therefore have biases of their own. They are also able to find and report on people’s concerns, sensationalize stories and may not always be based on facts and evidence. Therefore, it is essential to meet regularly with, brief and educate the media on priority hazards and on response systems, and provides them with appropriate information so as to cultivate a respectful and trusted relationship with them. Media will enable a wider dissemination of messages on radio or other appropriate means. ",booklet3,675
1835,1837,"As part of your risk communication plan, determine how you will announce news of the outbreak and then how you will keep the media regularly informed. Often, regular press releases and media briefings are appropriate tools for communicating with the media. If the emergency is complex, convening a workshop with targeted media is helpful to ensure correct information is disseminated, as most journalists have not been trained in medicine or public health.",booklet3,456

1877,1879,"Influenza A H7 viruses are a group of influenza viruses that normally circulate among birds. The influenza A (H7N9) virus is one subgroup among the larger group of H7 viruses. Although some H7 viruses (H7N2, H7N3 and H7N7) have occasionally been found to infect humans, no human infections with H7N9 viruses have been reported until recent reports from China.",booklet3,359
1878,1880,What are the main symptoms of human infection with influenza A (H7N9) virus?,booklet3,76
1879,1881,"Thus far, most patients with this infection have had severe pneumonia. Symptoms include fever, cough and shortness of breath. However, information is still limited about the full spectrum of disease that infection with influenza A (H7N9) virus might cause.",booklet3,256
1880,1882,Why is this virus infecting humans now?,booklet3,39
1881,1883,"We do not know the answer to this question yet, because we do not know the source of exposure for these human infections. However, analysis of the genes of these viruses suggests that although they have evolved from avian (bird) viruses, they show signs of adaption to growth in mammalian species. These adaptations include an ability to bind to mammalian cells, and to grow at temperatures close to the normal body temperature of mammals (which is lower than that of birds).",booklet3,475
1882,1884,What is known about previous human infections with H7 influenza viruses globally?,booklet3,81
1883,1885,"From 1996 to 2012, human infections with H7 influenza viruses (H7N2, H7N3, and H7N7) were reported in the Netherlands, Italy, Canada, United States of America, Mexico and the United Kingdom. Most of these infections occurred in association with poultry outbreaks. The infections mainly resulted in conjunctivitis and mild upper respiratory symptoms, with the exception of one death, which occurred in the Netherlands. Until now, no human infections with H7 influenza viruses have been reported in China.",booklet3,503
1884,1886,Is the influenza A (H7N9) virus different from influenza A (H1N1) and A (H5N1) viruses?,booklet3,87
1885,1887,Yes. All three viruses are influenza A virus but they are distinct from each other. H7N9 and H5N1 are considered animal influenza viruses that sometimes infect people. H1N1 viruses can be divided into those that normally infect people and those that normally infect animals.,booklet3,274
1886,1888,How did people become infected with the influenza A (H7N9) virus?,booklet3,65
1887,1889,"Some of the confirmed cases had contact with animals or with an animal environment. The virus has been found in a pigeon in a market in Shanghai. It is not yet known how persons became infected. The possibility of animal-to-human transmission is being investigated, as is the possibility of person-to-person transmission.",booklet3,321
1888,1890,How can infection with influenza A (H7N9) virus be prevented?,booklet3,61
1889,1891,"Although both the source of infection and the mode of transmission are uncertain, it is prudent to follow basic hygienic practices to prevent infection. They include hand and respiratory hygiene and food safety measures; ",booklet3,221

1896,1898,"Is it safe to eat meat, i.e. poultry and pork products?",booklet3,55
1897,1899,"Influenza viruses are not transmitted through consuming well-cooked food. Because influenza viruses are inactivated by normal temperatures used for cooking (so that food reaches 70°C in all parts— ""piping"" hot — no ""pink"" parts), it is safe to eat properly prepared and cooked meat, including from poultry and game birds. Diseased animals and animals that have died of diseases should not be eaten. In areas experiencing outbreaks, meat products can be safely consumed provided that these items are properly cooked and properly handled during food preparation. The consumption of raw meat and uncooked blood-based dishes is a high-risk practice and should be discouraged.",booklet3,671
1898,1900,Is it safe to visit live markets and farms in areas where human cases have been recorded?,booklet3,89
1899,1901,"If you visit live markets, avoid direct contact with live animals and surfaces which are in contact with animals. If you live on a farm and raise animals for food, such as pigs and poultry, be sure to keep children away from sick and dead animals; keep animal species separated as much as possible; and report immediately to local authorities any cases of sick and dead animals. Sick or dead animals should not be butchered and prepared for food.",booklet3,446
1900,1902,Is there a vaccine for the influenza A (H7N9) virus?,booklet3,52
1901,1903,"No vaccine for the prevention of influenza A (H7N9) infections is currently available. However, viruses have already been isolated and characterized from the initial cases. The first step in development of a vaccine is the selection of candidate viruses that could go into a vaccine. WHO, in collaboration with partners, will continue to characterize available influenza A (H7N9) viruses to identify the best candidate viruses. These candidate vaccine viruses can then be used for the manufacture of vaccine if this step becomes necessary.",booklet3,539
1902,1904,Does treatment exist for influenza A (H7N9) infection?,booklet3,54
1903,1905,"Laboratory testing conducted in China has shown that the influenza A (H7N9) viruses are sensitive to the anti-influenza drugs known as neuraminidase inhibitors (oseltamivir and zanamivir). When these drugs are given early in the course of illness, they have been found to be effective against seasonal influenza virus and influenza A(H5N1) virus infection. However, at this time, there is no experience with the use of these drugs for the treatment of H7N9 infection.",booklet3,467
1904,1906,Is the general population at risk from the influenza A (H7N9) virus?,booklet3,68
1905,1907,We do not yet know enough about these infections to determine whether there is a significant risk of community spread. This possibility is the subject of epidemiological investigations that are now taking place.,booklet3,211
1906,1908,Are health care workers at risk from the influenza A (H7N9) influenza virus?,booklet3,76
1907,1909,"Health care workers often come into contact with patients with infectious diseases. Therefore, WHO recommends that appropriate infection prevention and control measures be consistently applied in health care settings, and that the health status of health care workers be closely monitored. Together with standard precautions, health care workers caring for those suspected or confirmed to have influenza A(H7N9) infection should use additional precautions ",booklet3,456
1908,1910,Does this influenza virus pose a pandemic threat?,booklet3,49
1909,1911,"Any animal influenza virus that develops the ability to infect people is a theoretical risk to cause a pandemic. However, whether the influenza A(H7N9) virus could actually cause a pandemic is unknown. Other animal influenza viruses that have been found to occasionally infect people have not gone on to cause a pandemic.",booklet3,321

1976,1978,"Anthrax is an acute illness caused by Bacillus anthracis, a gram positive, encapsulated, spore forming and none motile bacteria. The disease commonly affects wild and domestic herbivores, human and carnivores are incidental hosts. Three occurrence forms of the disease in human include cutaneous, inhalation and gastrointestinal anthrax. The transmission of the disease can be through intestine (ingestion), Respiratory (inhalation) and skin (cutaneous) from infected animal tissues and from infected person.",booklet3,508
1977,1979,The worldwide estimate of the disease burden is not well known; however occasional epidemics do occur (WHO 2005),booklet3,112
1978,1980,"An outbreak of anthrax in in Mwansambo, Nkhotakota District, was reported to the Ministry of Health (MoH) by the Director of Health and Social Services (DHSS).

2001,2003,"The index case reported at the Mwansambo Health Centre on 6/12/2015. The index case (Kenneth Mbwibwi) was a male of 39 years living in Kaigwazanga Village in Mwansambo, Mphimbi Ward. The index case is the son of the owner of the dead cow. (This family had one cow and one goat).  This outbreak is said to have occurred after the slaughtering of the dead cow. It was noted that the cow died on 3/12/2015, the family did not notify the veterinary officer for inspection, the cow was slaughtered at home by Kenneth with the help of a neighbour called Guza who also distributed the meat to the relatives and neighbours. The cow skin was given to the dogs. The second day on 4/12/2015, the index case was slaughtering the head part of the dead cow and accidentally he pricked one of his finger with the cow bones. On 6/12/2015, the index case had a swollen finger (the pricked finger). On 7/12/2015, the goat died and was slaughtered by the index case, the goat meat was eaten by only the family members. On 8/12/2015 the index case realised that the hand that was pricked was swollen, he was rushed to Mwansambo Health Centre. In charge of the health centre suspected the patient with Anthrax and he administered the patient with Amoxicillin for five days and pain killers. After few days without recovering, on 12/12/2015 he went back to the hospital and he presented with swelling on the right upper limb (RUL) and chest, massive swelling of the RUL and chest with eschar on the wound.

2037,2039,The community was not well informed about anthrax and how to handle the dying animals,booklet3,85
2038,2040,A close link between the DHSS and the DVO is lacking until when zoonotic outbreaks appear,booklet3,89
2039,2041,6.	Recommendations,booklet3,18
2040,2042,The veterinary sector should intensify vaccination program by increasing the coverage and providing regular and timely vaccines to livestock especially against zoonotic diseases which are prone to epidemics,booklet3,206
2041,2043,The community should be well informed about anthrax and other zoonotic and how to handle the dying animals.,booklet3,107
2042,2044,There should be a close link between the DHSS and the DVO in dealing with zoonotic; this will ensure a One Health approach.,booklet3,123
2043,2045,Animal preliminary tests for diagnosis should be a basic thing to start with before anything else; this will give a clue of what we are dealing with,booklet3,148
2044,2046,7.	Conclusion,booklet3,13
2045,2047,The outbreak of Anthrax in Central Region was established through the laboratory confirmation from human case and the cattle. All the cases were linked to the dead cows making that a cause for an outbreak. Slaughtering and handling of meat to the dead cows were the major risk factors for acquiring the disease in human. The outbreak was declared over on 14th January 2016.,booklet3,373

95,97,FOREWORD,booklet2,8
96,98,"In 1998, the World Health Organization (WHO) Regional Office for Africa (AFRO) together with technical partners adopted a strategy for developing and implementing comprehensive public health surveillance and response systems in African countries, initially called integrated disease surveillance (IDS). However, to highlight the linkage between surveillance and response, the strategy was later re-named Integrated Disease Surveillance and Response (IDSR). Malawi adopted the first edition of the IDSR technical guidelines in 2005. Since then, there has been an investment in human and material resources to strengthen capacities for public health surveillance systems in order to prevent, timely detect, and respond appropriately to public health threats. ",booklet2,757
97,99,"The coming into force, in 2007, of the International Health Regulations (IHR 2005), the emergence of new diseases, conditions and events and the formulation of strategies for disaster risk management (DRM) resulted in the need to revise the first edition of the IDSR technical guidelines. There was also the need to address the increasing burden of non-communicable diseases. Furthermore, there was the need to strengthen community-based surveillance for early detection, rapid confirmation and response to public health threats. Moreover, alignment with broader system strengthening objectives was required. Hence, in 2010, the second edition of the IDSR guidelines was developed, which Malawi subsequently adapted in 2014.",booklet2,724
98,100,"Diseases, both communicable and non-communicable, continue to be a major cause of morbidity and mortality in Malawi and in the Africa region as a whole despite the advanced global knowledge on how to detect and control them. Of late, non-communicable diseases are increasingly becoming a major public health problem in the country. The majority of non-communicable diseases are preventable but multiple factors which include environmental, social, and economic determinants hamper effective prevention and control of these diseases. Emerging and re-emerging diseases and conditions pose a threat to the country’s health security. ",booklet2,630
99,101,"Responding to health emergencies remains a major challenge, as shown by recent health emergencies in the country as well as the African region, the unprecedented Ebola Virus Disease of 2014, the ongoing Coronavirus Disease of 2019 Pandemic. Specifically, challenges in capacity to prevent, detect and respond to public health threats have been identified. As one way of addressing these problems, the Ministry of Health is strengthening the disease surveillance systems using the Third Edition of the guidelines for IDSR as revised by the WHO-AFRO in 2018 and adapted to our context in 2020.",booklet2,591
100,102,"It is worth noting that, many Public Health Events (PHEs) and emergencies and their associated risk factors could be prevented or their effects mitigated. However, the health systems in most countries remain inadequate.  To avert and mitigate the effects of future health security risks and emergencies, Malawi intends to  implement these IDSR technical guidelines.  These guidelines recommend thresholds for action for priority diseases, conditions, public health events and responding to alerts. Using these action thresholds can be lifesaving. Therefore, it is important that we scale up and fully implement this third edition of the IDSR technical guidelines in the country as they explicitly describe what needs to be established at each level of the health system in order to detect, confirm and respond to diseases, conditions and health events that are responsible for  illness, deaths and disability in local communities.",booklet2,930
101,103,"The cost of good public health surveillance as a public health good is relatively very low compared to many other strategies. Let us all embrace these IDSR technical guidelines to strengthen capacities for preparedness, alert and response for health security in the country.",booklet2,274
102,104,"These guidelines are to be used by all relevant multisectoral stakeholders at all levels as general reference for surveillance activities, set of standard definitions for threshold levels that initiate action for responding to specific diseases, stand-alone reference for level-specific responsibilities, resource for developing training, supervision, monitoring and evaluation of surveillance activities, and as a guide for improving early detection and response of epidemic prone diseases.",booklet2,491
103,105,"Finally, I appeal to you all to ensure that the third edition of the IDSR technical guidelines are implemented within a broader context of health system strengthening; better coordination between human and animal health surveillance and other sectors involved in One Health approach; improved use of laboratory network capacity in surveillance and response; and better community engagement in public health interventions.",booklet2,421

114,116,"The IDSR strategy incorporates both Indicator-Based surveillance (IBS) and Event-Based Surveillance (EBS) approaches to early detect priority diseases, conditions, and events. This section describes how to detect priority diseases, conditions, and events using standard case definitions. The section also gives guidance on establishing EBS and using this approach for alerts detection, triaging, and verification to detect public health events. The section also describes procedures that need to be followed when planning for improvements of surveillance and response activities in your catchment area and emphasizes the role of the laboratory in surveillance and response.",booklet2,673
115,117,"1.1 Detection of priority diseases, conditions and events",booklet2,57
116,118,"Health staff (human, animal, and environmental) conducts surveillance activities at all levels of the health system (public and private), so they can detect public health problems of concern in their communities. ",booklet2,213
117,119,"Community members also play an essential role in surveillance by facilitating early detection and action to priority diseases, conditions, and events. Community members should be oriented about the concept, notion and importance of surveillance to actively detect, report, respond to, and monitor health events related to humans or animals in their catchment area. ",booklet2,365
118,120,"Various public health events and/or risks may also present at Points of Entry (PoE); and these health events can be recognized before, during, or after travel, often when travellers have already left the Point of Entry. Staff at Points of Entry must be vigilant in ensuring that these events are identified and reported on time to facilitate response.",booklet2,351
119,121,"Surveillance priorities may be communicable and non-communicable diseases, conditions, or events that include national or local priorities such as acute outbreaks and deaths or events associated with human and/or animal health events which might have direct consequences to human health. An essential function of a public health surveillance system is to be vigilant in its capacity to detect not only known public health threats with established case definitions and formal reporting channels but also events or hazards that are not explicitly included in the formal reporting system. These may be events such as clusters of disease patterns or rumours of unexplained deaths.",booklet2,676
120,122,"These diseases, conditions, and events may come to the attention of the health system in several ways.",booklet2,102
121,123,For example:,booklet2,12

123,125,High rate of hospital admission for the same diseases or symptoms ,booklet2,66
124,126,"Community members report unusual events or occurrences at local levels such as a cluster of deaths or unusual disease patterns to the health facility, or perhaps a school might report noteworthy absences due to similar signs and symptoms such as an influenza-like illness (ILI). ",booklet2,279
125,127,"Health staffs who conduct periodic record reviews to find cases for a specific disease observe that cases of another priority disease have not been reported. For example, an officer who normally reviews the clinic register for Acute Flaccid Paralysis (AFP) cases also sees that a case of cholera has also recently been recorded in the clinic register.",booklet2,351
126,128,Health staffs conduct routine record reviews of the laboratory register and observe recorded confirmed cases of priority diseases such as yellow fever or cholera.,booklet2,162
127,129,"Radio, television, newspapers, or social media (WhatsApp, Facebook, etc.) report a rumour of rare or unexplained events in the area with potential exposure for humans.",booklet2,167

129,131,Unusual reports of illness among health care workers ,booklet2,53
130,132,"During analysis of the routine reports from all the facilities in the area, the IDSR focal person notices that other health facilities in the catchment area have also reported adult deaths due to bloody diarrhoea, which might signify there might be an outbreak of Bacillary dysenteriae or Escherichia coli",booklet2,305
131,133,"An unusual death or number of deaths among animals, such as livestock, birds or rodent species, or an unusually high number of sick animals presenting with the same signs, ",booklet2,172
132,134,"During an assessment of water bodies, Environmental Health Officers observed contamination due to oil spills, chemicals like lead, or other related chemicals from mining activities or different sources, which might be an early trigger for public health interventions.",booklet2,267
133,135,"1.2 Indicator-based Surveillance (IBS) and Event-Based Surveillance (EBS) approaches used to detect priority diseases, conditions and events",booklet2,140
134,136,"The IDSR strategy uses both Indicator-Based Surveillance (IBS) and Event-Based Surveillance (EBS) approaches to detect priority diseases, conditions, and events.",booklet2,161
135,137,Indicator-Based surveillance (IBS) involves reports of specific diseases from health care providers to public health officials. Such information may be described as structured information because the information obtained is standardized.,booklet2,237
136,138,"Event-based surveillance (EBS) is defined as the organized collection, monitoring, assessment and interpretation of mainly unstructured ad hoc information regarding health events or risks, which may represent an acute risk to health.",booklet2,233
137,139,"As part of efforts to increase the sensitivity of the surveillance system, it is recommended by the World Health Orgnization that all countries should also establish EBS system alongside with the IBS at all levels of the health system i.e. at national, district, health facility and community levels.",booklet2,300

139,141,"In contrast to case definitions that are narrow and disease-specific, EBS requires the detection and immediate reporting of alerts, which are broad and indicate the possibility of a serious public health event. Alerts that are verified are classified as events.",booklet2,261

144,146,"A standard case definition is an agreed-upon set of criteria used to decide if a person has a particular suspected disease or condition. The definition specifies clinical criteria, laboratory diagnosis and specifications on time, place and person. ",booklet2,248
145,147,Why do we need case definitions?,booklet2,32
146,148,"To help decide if a person has a presumed disease or condition or event, or to exclude other potential disease diagnoses.",booklet2,121
147,149,"To ensure that every case is diagnosed in the same way, regardless of where or when it occurred, or who identified it. ",booklet2,119
148,150,To initiate action for reporting and investigation quickly if the clinical diagnosis takes longer to confirm.,booklet2,109
149,151,"To compare the number of cases of the diseases, conditions or events that occurred in one time or place with the number occurring in another time or place. ",booklet2,156
150,152,"Using standard case definitions is also important in implementing the IHR (2005). At all levels, including community, health staff (human, animal, environment) must be aware of case definitions of diseases, condition or events that may afflict not only the local community but also have the potential for spread across geographic boundaries.",booklet2,341
151,153,"In describing Standard Case Definitions, for health facility level, a three-tiered classification system is normally used – Suspected, Probable, Confirmed:",booklet2,155
152,154,"Suspected case: indicative clinical picture i.e., patient will have fewer or atypical clinical features without being a confirmed or a probable case or is linked epidemiologically to a probable or confirmed case.",booklet2,212
153,155,"Probable case: clear clinical picture (meets the clinical case definition) i.e., patient will have typical clinical features of the illness or linked epidemiologically to a confirmed case but a laboratory sample cannot be taken because the case is lost or dead or a sample has been taken but not available for laboratory testing or was not viable for sufficient laboratory testing or test results is inconclusive or staff are not able to take a sample for some reasons.",booklet2,469
154,156,Confirmed case: a suspected or probable case verified by laboratory analysis,booklet2,76
155,157,The classification might vary according to the epidemiology of the individual diseases. ,booklet2,88
156,158,"In all outbreak scenarios, a more sensitive case definition to identify all suspected cases should always be used. Identification of cases in these scenarios will use the Syndromic surveillance approach where case detection will be based on clinical features without any laboratory diagnosis (See Introduction chapter for the description of Syndromic surveillance). If in the middle of an outbreak, the cause of the agent has been established, cases may continue to be classified as either suspected cases or confirmed cases. An additional tier classification i.e.  “Probable case definition” may be added if officials feel that conducting laboratory tests on every patient with a consistent clinical picture and a history of exposure (e.g., measles) is unnecessary.",booklet2,766
157,159,"Case definitions at the community level are usually simplified and are used to facilitate rapid detection of priority diseases, events and conditions or other hazards in the community. Case definitions at this level use key signs and symptoms to help the community to recognize when they should refer a person with these signs and symptoms for treatment and notify the health facility. Examples of how key signs and symptoms of community case definitions may be described are in Annex 1B of this section.",booklet2,504

Show them how to fill information and those who are non-literate, develop mechanisms of capturing information of events from them. Think of mechanisms like identifying someone from the family member who can assist with actual writing. In addition, provide information to the community on priority diseases, using posters, newsletters and announcements during meetings.

258,260,This step involves two major activities namely establishing EBS Hotlines and Media Scanning Centres as described below:,booklet2,119
259,261,A.  Establish EBS Hotlines:,booklet2,27
260,262,"A hotline is a phone line that the public can use to obtain information from an organization or to give the organization information. It is a short number to receive direct phone calls or information from social media platforms such as WhatsApp, Facebook, or Twitter, and rumours from communities (words from mouth). ",booklet2,317
261,263,It should be toll free to the public – meaning the cost of reporting alerts to public health authorities should be ZERO.,booklet2,120
262,264,"It is recommended to have a single number that can be used as a hotline to make reporting easy to remember. The same number can be used for hotline, Short Message Service (SMS), Unstructured Supplementary Service Data (USSD) and social media platforms to avoid confusion. For example, Malawi’s Public Halth Emergency Operation Centre (PHEOC) hotline number is “929”, messages sent by SMS or Facebook, WhatsApp Messenger should also be sent to the same number.",booklet2,459
263,265,"Community residents should be motivated to self-report events that may impact the public’s health, including emerging public health events or outbreaks.",booklet2,152
264,266,"Disseminate the hotline number by advocacy through health authourities, community health volunteers, non-governmental organizations, religious and other leaders, or schools and also advertise through messaging in local languages by TV, radio, newspapers and digital social media platforms.",booklet2,289
265,267,"Develop partnership with communication companies that can spread the hotline number by test messages to their clients. The messages sent should include the purpose of the EBS, the importance of immediately reporting alerts and how alerts can be reported.",booklet2,254
266,268,Train a team of employees to operate the EBS hotline 24 hours to respond to calls or request information from the community. This can and shall be integrated as one of the routine activities of the PHEOC.,booklet2,204
267,269,The Call methodology: ,booklet2,22
268,270,"The responder to the call should start by greeting and thanking them for their proactivity to report to the ministry of health or rellevant ministry hosting the hotline, concerning potential public health events.",booklet2,212
269,271,Then the responder should follow a prepared set of questions that directly reflect parametersin the alert logbook. (Annex 1H of this section),booklet2,141
270,272,"The call should be ended by thanking the caller for their time , patience and proactivity.",booklet2,90
271,273,The responder should directly register in the digital alert logbook the alerts that meet the pre-defined list of alerts.,booklet2,120
272,274,Calls should be returned as soon as possible in situations where a call is interupted or disconnected or if calls are received while the responder is busy; this will ensure that all alerts are collected.,booklet2,203
273,275,The Messaging methodology: ,booklet2,27
274,276,"Once an SMS or a social media message is received, an instant automated message should greet the sender, thank them and state that an operator will contact them.",booklet2,161
275,277,Automated questions in the digital product so it can collect information from the sender.,booklet2,89
276,278,Data should be registered directly in the digital alert logbook according to the pre-defined list of alerts for Malawi and imported to the Rumour Log of the One Healh Surveillance Platform (OHSP).,booklet2,196
277,279,Information about the sender should be collected for further communication and details about the alerts reported. A direct call to the sender may be needed if more information is required.,booklet2,188
278,280,NB: Hotlines should be established at National and District level.,booklet2,66
279,281,At National level: The hotline with the call respondents shall be established at the National Public Health Emergency Operation Centre (PHEOC) to capture and register alerts from the entire country.,booklet2,198
280,282,At District Level: The hotline can be established at the District Health Office premises to capture and register alerts from the district including the health facilities and community focal persons. The district level hotline shall be able to receive routing calls from the National level PHEOC in the event of urgent needs.,booklet2,324
281,283,B.  Establish Media Scanning Centre,booklet2,35
282,284,"Media are channels of general communication amongst a population and they act as gathering tools used to store and disseminate information or data. E.g. newspapers, magazines, TV, radio, bulletins, social media and other printed forms of communication, as well as electronic or online sources.",booklet2,293
283,285,Media scanning is an active process that should be performed using different media.,booklet2,83
284,286,Media scanning is recommended to be performed at national level as one of the routine activities of the PHEOC.,booklet2,110
285,287,Train health personnel or PHEOC operators to conduct media scanning regularly e.g. daily.,booklet2,89
286,288,The sources of media scanning can be official and non-official.,booklet2,63
287,289,Official Media sources: ,booklet2,24
288,290,NB: Alerts detected from official sources are reliable and do not need further verification.,booklet2,92
289,291,Examples of official media sources:,booklet2,35
290,292,"Websites of governmental sectors including, Ministries of Health, Agriculture, Environment, Foreign Affairs etc.",booklet2,112
291,293,"Websites for official organizations such as universities and international recognized centres of research e.g. CDC, Africa CDC.",booklet2,127
292,294,"WHO Official websites for Early Warning e.g. WHO IHR Event Information Site for National Focal Points, which is secured platform accessible only to national focal points.",booklet2,170
293,295,WHO Disease Outbreak News.,booklet2,26
294,296,"Websites for WHO regional offices e.g. AFRO, EMRO, EURO, SEARO, WPRO, PAHO.",booklet2,75
295,297,Disease-specific websites e.g. Global Influenza Surveillance and Response.,booklet2,74
296,298,Unofficial Media sources:,booklet2,25
297,299,NB: Alerts detected through these sources are not reliable and need to be verified.,booklet2,83
298,300,Examples of unofficial media sources:,booklet2,37
299,301,Newspapers and magazines,booklet2,24
300,302,Online content of TV and radio channels,booklet2,39
301,303,"Social media e.g. WhatsApp, Facebook, Twitter ",booklet2,46
302,304,"Unofficial websites e.g. ProMED, The Global Information Network (GPHIN), HealthMap, MEDISYS etc.",booklet2,96
303,305,Methods of online media scanning,booklet2,32
304,306,Online information scanning can be done manually and automatically,booklet2,66
305,307,The Steps for Manual Scanning,booklet2,29
306,308,Develop a checklist for scheduled (e.g. Daily) review of online sources.,booklet2,72
307,309,"Develop a list of prioritized alerts regarding strategies, capacities and resources for Malawi.",booklet2,95
308,310,"Develop a list for keywords related to the prioritized alerts including diseases, syndromes or events.",booklet2,102
309,311,Visit all predetermined websites in the checklist of online sources to scan for keywords. ,booklet2,90
310,312,The Steps for Automated Scanning,booklet2,32
311,313,There are multiple automated technological tools that can be used for scanning of online information from predefined sources.,booklet2,125
312,314,These tools can save time and effort and support early detection of public health threats.,booklet2,90
313,315,Examples of automated scanning are:,booklet2,35
314,316,Rich site summary i.e. RSS feeds are standardized software tools that monitor the pre-defined websites and inform the user with updates.,booklet2,136
315,317,"Contributor-based sources are based on sharing information among health professionals, in which individuals collect information that can be accessed through shared feeds e.g. ProMed. ",booklet2,183
316,318,Automated information feeds or services developed by governments or international organizations that collect health information from several sources and then can decrease time spent in scanning for individual sources. These are called data aggregators.,booklet2,252
317,319,"“Google Alert” service: it is a content change detection and notification service, offered by the search engine company Google. The service sends emails to the user when it finds new results—such as web pages, newspaper articles, blogs, or scientific research—that match the user's search term. Surveillance officers can set-up the key words for automated scanning using the Google Alert service.",booklet2,396
318,320,Step 2: Alerts Detection,booklet2,24
319,321,Alerts detection is the process of capturing information on the potential public health events reported to the hotline.,booklet2,119
320,322,"Members of the general public may communicate with the hotline desk through phone calls, SMS, USSD, social media messaging or website chats.",booklet2,140
321,323,The hotline desk team should filter received notifications from callers to determine which alerts are valid.,booklet2,108
322,324,"A list of alerts developed by national public health authourities should be provided to the hotline desk operators, or responders, so that they are able to continue with the registration of alerts.",booklet2,197
323,325,The call responder and operator should register valid alerts in the alert logbook.,booklet2,82
324,326,Alerts can also be detected by media scanning either manually or automated.,booklet2,75
325,327,Examples of pre-detemined alerts:,booklet2,33
326,328,"Code﷐Alerts to be reported﷐01﷐Two or more persons presenting with similar severe illness in the same setting (e.g. household, workplace, school, street) within one week﷐02﷐Unexplained large number of deaths of poultry, livestock, other domestic animals or wildlife﷐03﷐Severe illness of a healthcare worker after exposure to patients with similar symptoms﷐04﷐One or more hospitalized patients with unexplained severe illness, including failure to respond to standard treatment",booklet2,475
327,329,Step 3: Registration of EBS Alerts,booklet2,34
328,330,"Alerts that are captured from media and hotlines and correspond to the pre-defined list of alerts, should be registered in the alert book. See Sample Alert Logbook for Hotlines and/or Media Scanning on the next page.",booklet2,216
329,331,"Each alert captured should include data about the alert’s detection, triage and verification, until the response.",booklet2,113
330,332,Alert registration should include the minimum data set for tracking the alerts for example;,booklet2,91
331,333,"Source/informant: Name, contact phone and time and date of the call/detection;",booklet2,78
332,334,"Alert: when it happened, who was affected (cases, deaths) and where it starts and spreads.",booklet2,90
333,335,"Follow-up of the alert: Triage, verification, risk assessment and response.",booklet2,75
334,336,Sample Alert Logbook for Hotlines and/or Media Scanning,booklet2,55

336,338,Step 4: Conduct triaging of EBS Alerts,booklet2,38
337,339,Conduct assessment of alerts for verification,booklet2,45
338,340,The Incident Management System (IMS) Triage Manager shall conduct the initial assessment of the registered EBS alerts and triage them accordingly.,booklet2,146
339,341,"If the alert matches with one of the priority alerts for Malawi, the alert should immediately undergo verification.",booklet2,115
340,342,"If the alert is generically defined, e.g. an unusual event that may pose a public health threat, a qualified public health specialist or team leader should assess the alert to decide whether to discard the alert, or to proceed for verification.",booklet2,244
341,343,Step 5: Conduct Verification of EBS Alerts,booklet2,42
342,344,Verification is an essential step to confirm the validity of the captured alerts and should be conducted by the rapid response team (RRT).,booklet2,138
343,345,Verification should be done at the local level nearest to the location of the alert.,booklet2,84
344,346,"If the alert is detected at national level, this is reported to the respective district IDSR focal person where the alert is located by phone call or Instant Message (e.g. WhatsApp) or SMS or email etc. ",booklet2,203
345,347,A trained district RRT with support from national experts should conduct verification of the alerts.,booklet2,100
346,348,All alerts should be verified within 24hours.,booklet2,45
347,349,"Once an alert is verified and requires action, it is determined to be an event.",booklet2,79
348,350,"District RRT with support from national experts should promptly start investigations by collecting further information in the field (conducting physical examinations, collecting lab samples etc.) using the existing respective IDSR case/event investigation forms.",booklet2,262
349,351,The confirmed events that meet the standard case definition should be captured by the respective IDSR focal person in the IBS system and reported to the national level i.e. through the existing IDSR data collection tools and follow the IDSR reporting procedures (refer to Section 2 of these 3rd Edition Malawi IDSR Technical Guidelines).,booklet2,337
350,352,Step 6: Conduct risk assessment and characterization,booklet2,52
351,353,"Once an alert is verified as an event, risk assessment begins. ",booklet2,63
352,354,"Risk assessment is a systematic and continuous process for gathering, assessing and documenting information to provide the basis for actions to manage and reduce the negative consequences of an acute public health event. ",booklet2,221
353,355,The first risk assessment of an event should take place within 48 hours of the detection of one or more alerts.,booklet2,111
354,356,The National team should lead the risk assessment with the respective district RRT. ,booklet2,84
355,357,Every assessment is a process by which the available information about a real event is analysed and judgement is made as to whether it poses an immediate risk to public health. In this case full risk assessment is done (refer to section 4 of the 3rd Edition Malawi IDSR Technical Guidelines). ,booklet2,293
356,358,"For alerts that has been substantiated as true event but do not pose an immediate threat to public, the team should monitor the event and undertake risk assessments when new information becomes available",booklet2,203
357,359,Steps for establishing EBS at district level,booklet2,44
358,360,The steps for establishing EBS at district level follows similarly as at the national level.,booklet2,92
359,361,"However, the District RRT mostly receives EBS-related information in the form of alerts mainly from the health facilities and communities through phone calls/text messages/WhatsApp/verbal. ",booklet2,189
360,362,Receive and document alert reports:,booklet2,35
361,363,"Record verbal or written information from health facilities and communities about suspected outbreaks, rumours, unexplained events/alerts into the District Logbook of suspected outbreaks (refer to Section 4, Annex 4A of these 3rd Edition Malawi IDSR Technical Guidelines).",booklet2,272
362,364,"The district RRT should carry out the following functions: Triaging, Verification and Risk Assessment.",booklet2,102
363,365,Triage alerts,booklet2,13
364,366,"When the District RRT receive information about a reported alert, they should conduct triaging by asking the following questions:",booklet2,129
365,367,Is the reported information relevant to early warning (i.e. could this alert be genuine public health event?),booklet2,109
366,368,"Was this alert previously reported (i.e., is this alert a duplicate?)",booklet2,69
367,369,"Triage can take place in person-field visit, by text messaging or over the phone.",booklet2,81
368,370,After triage:,booklet2,13
369,371,"If the report is not relevant or is a duplicate, then it can be discarded. There is no further action that is needed to be taken.",booklet2,129
370,372,"If the information is to be discarded, communicate the following information to the IDSR facility focal persons/Surveillance focal persons who reported the alert:",booklet2,162
371,373,They should continue to monitor the situation and notify the district if the situation changes and alert is met.,booklet2,112
372,374,"It is okay that they have reported an alert that has been determined to be false alert, and they are encouraged to continue reporting alerts when they are detected.",booklet2,164
373,375,"If the report is pertinent and is not a duplicate, then the information must be verified by the district RRT that received the information about the alert.",booklet2,155
374,376,Verify alerts,booklet2,13
375,377,The district RRT must verify all triaged alerts that are pertinent to EBS.,booklet2,74
376,378,The district RRT receiving alerts from health facilities and communities must also verify these alerts before they are determined to be events.,booklet2,143
377,379,"Verification is the determination that an alert is valid (i.e. it is not a false alarm or a false rumour), reliable, and that it corresponds to at least one of the alerts pre-defined for EBS implementation.",booklet2,206
378,380,"Criteria for verification may include asking questions of those who have notified the alert to ensure that they have correctly understood the alert, whether or not the alert has been confirmed by at least two different sources, or the fact that the alert has been notified by a person with medical authority (e.g. veterinarian, physician or lab assistant.",booklet2,355
379,381,"To conduct verification, the district RRT will ask questions of the person reporting the alert, and possibly other people as well. This can include the patient, the family and friends of the patient and/or other people within the community.",booklet2,240
380,382,Verification can take place in person by field visit or over the phone.,booklet2,71
381,383,Use the EBS verification tool; see sample of Event-Based Surveillance: Verification Tool on next page.,booklet2,102
382,384,The result of verification is the confirmation that the alert is true or false. Once alert is verified it becomes an event. ,booklet2,124
383,385,After verification:,booklet2,19
384,386,"If the alert is considered to be a public health event, it is reported to immediately to the national level.",booklet2,108
385,387,"If the alert is not considered to be a public health event, the situation will be monitored to ensure it does not become a public health event.",booklet2,143
386,388,Record confirmed events in existing IDSR data collection tools and platforms and report to next level (Refer to Section 2 of these 3rd Edition Malawi IDSR Technical Guidelines).,booklet2,177
387,389,Conduct Risk Assessment as per the national guidance.,booklet2,53
388,390,Sample of Event-Based Surveillance: Verification Tool,booklet2,53
389,391,"When an alert is notified by a ComBaS Focal Person or health facility, District RRT will use this tool to verify whether the alert is TRUE or FALSE ",booklet2,148
390,392,The process of alert verification should answer three main questions:,booklet2,69
391,393,Is the report accurate (i.e. true)?,booklet2,35
392,394,Has the information been reported by a reliable source or sources?,booklet2,66
393,395,Does the report meet the criteria for one or more alerts?,booklet2,57
394,396,Steps for establishing EBS at health facility level,booklet2,51
395,397,The steps involve considering the following important points:,booklet2,61
396,398,"Indicator-Based Surveillance (IBS) in health facilities encompasses immediate, weekly and monthly reporting of pre-determined list of diseases based on case definitions.",booklet2,169
397,399,"Event-Based Surveillance (EBS) in health facilities (HEBS) trains clinicians, nurses, and other relevant healthcare professionals to report on pattern of disease alerts, such as a cluster of illnesses and is not disease specific.",booklet2,229
398,400,"EBS may allow for detection of emerging or re-emerging public health threats because it is not disease-specific, requires immediate notification, and is highly sensitive and broad.",booklet2,180
399,401,"Additionally, since reporting does not require laboratory results for reporting and relies on clinicians’ experience, EBS is more practical and fairly simple to establish and sustain.",booklet2,183
400,402,"Health facilities should participate in both IBS and EBS since the two complement each other leading to early detection of diseases, conditions and events.",booklet2,155
401,403,Steps for establishing EBS in health facilities,booklet2,47
402,404,Step 1: Alert detection,booklet2,23
403,405,Select and train IDSR facility focal persons: Existing IDSR facility focal persons can be trained to perform this role.,booklet2,119
404,406,IDSR facility focal persons must inform other staff to immediately notify them when they see or hear about one of the alerts happening in their workplace.,booklet2,154
405,407,"Healthcare professionals including clinicians, nurses, and preventive health officers should be sensitized to recognize alerts and report them immediately.",booklet2,155
406,408,Detecting an alert means identifying or suspecting the occurrence of the pre-determined alerts designated by national public health authorities.,booklet2,144
407,409,Examples of HFEBS alerts:,booklet2,25
408,410,"Code﷐Health Facility EBS Alerts to be reported﷐01﷐Any severe illness in health staff after taking care of a patient with similar illness﷐02﷐Large, sudden increase in admission for any severe illness of the same type﷐03﷐Any severe, unusual, unexplainable illness including a failure to respond to standard treatment﷐04﷐Increase use of a particular medicine",booklet2,355
409,411,Step 2: Reporting Alerts,booklet2,24
410,412,Reporting alerts involves communicating with an IDSR facility focal person/surveillance Focal Persons in the health facilities who intend report to the district RRT immediately.,booklet2,177
411,413,"This can be done by telephone call, SMS, or in person, but it must happen immediately: on the same day and as soon as possible.",booklet2,127
412,414,Step 3: Triaging and verification,booklet2,33
413,415,The district RRT upon receipt of report of alerts should triage and verify all alerts within 24 hours of alert detection using the verification tool.,booklet2,149
414,416,In case of true event immediate investigations and response measures is implemented as per the existing IDSR structures.,booklet2,120
415,417,The district RRT should provide regular feedback to the reporting health facilities.,booklet2,84
416,418,Annex 1D: List of district reporting sites,booklet2,42
417,419,"Record information for contacting the health workers or community health workers or PoE officers or anyone who provide information to the district related to surveillance and outbreak, events detection.

492,494,"From community level health worker to health centre and facilities, paper-based tools are the most commonly used tools for reporting these diseases, events and conditions. The Ministry of Health is, however, working on a digital Integrated Community Health Information system (iCHIS) to support this reporting need. Whereas, from all health facilities to report to district and national level, an IDSR focal person reports data electronically through the One Health Surveillance platform (OHSP) with DHIS-2 technology. Electronic tools facilitate rapid transmission of data to enable timely response to public health threats is defined as eIDSR. The potential benefits of using electronic reporting tools for eIDSR include: more timely reporting, investigation, and response to outbreaks. Electronic reporting may also improve data quality; enhance virtual, near real-time disease and events monitoring capability; may lead to reduced system costs and easily generate automated alerts. The OHSP is one of the eIDSR tool to facilitate the needs. In addition, information can be more easily stored, accessed and analysed.

Malawi will embrace an interoperable and “One Health” approach of strengthening eIDSR by creating systematic linkages and information sharing platforms. This will be done by formalizing agreements between Ministry of Health, Ministry of Agriculture and Ministry of Nature Resources. Internally, the eIDSR will include all relevant health programmes, departments, sections and units within the MoH, i.e. HMIS, IDSR, Maternal (MDSR), community health service section (iCHIS) and Newborn (PDSR), health services delivery information system (EMRS), national public health reference laboratories and laboratory networks (LIMS).

Immediate reporting should also be done for diseases and events considered priorities at the national level which may not necessarily be PHEICs. The diseases, conditions and events requiring immediate notification to the next level are listed in Table 2.1 Immediate reporting allows timely action to be taken to prevent the re-emergence or rapid transmission of epidemic prone diseases or events or their propagation, especially those due to highly virulent infectious, chemical, biological or radio nuclear agents.",booklet2,744
496,498,"Information that is reported immediately, such as single cases or clusters of reportable events, will generate an alert and initiate a case-based surveillance reporting system. This means that, specific information about that suspected case or if it is a cluster, specific information of each of cases identified, will be collected thoroughly and reported to the next level. At the same time, an initial investigation will be initiated. For events reported at PoE, information is reported to the next level (district where the PoE is situated) as well as simultaneously to the IHR NFP. Reporting units with no diagnostic capacity will use the suspected case definition given to identify and report diseases, conditions and events.

For example, at the health facility or district, the surveillance focal point can draw an epidemic curve to see if and when the epidemic thresholds for specific diseases have been crossed. Additionally, these data from epidemic investigation (using Annex 2M tool) can be used to check whether the case fatality rate is below, at or above the expected target; the potential risk factors, etc. The weekly data analysis of the suspected or confirmed epidemic should also help point out possible high-risk groups with regard to a patients’ case location or residence, age group, sex, and exposure during social events (for example, a funeral), occupational hazards (for example, butchering), consuming game meat, or exposure to a contaminated food or beverage.

Additionally, an in-depth analysis of individual immediate case-based surveillance reporting forms received from the reporting sites will also be performed, in addition to the weekly aggregated data. The incidence and case fatality rates should be calculated and compared with the set alert and epidemic thresholds to determine if it is increasing or decreasing. Epidemic curves should be updated regularly to monitor the trends or evolution of epidemics occurring in the districts. Districts are required to store the information electronically and forward the surveillance data sets to the next higher level of health system in the digital format.",booklet2,978

In this system, ComBaS focal persons identify and report events in the community that have public health significance. ComBaS focal persons act as community informants, and they report to the health facility, or in the case of a serious event, directly to the district authorities.

A reporting site is a site which reports about surveillance and outbreak data to the next level. This includes all health facilities (public, private and quasi-governmental, faith based), standalone laboratories, and PoE. A reporting site also contains event reports from community surveillance and response.",booklet2,421
749,751,"At the health facility level, both in-patient and out-patient departments are surveillance sites. The information collected from the site is compiled in standard forms (Weekly and Monthly IDSR Summary Reporting Forms, Case-based Investigation forms, Line listing forms etc.), analysed and then forwarded, to the district health management team. In areas where there is already an eIDSR system, data are entered electronically using a mobile phone or a computer, and the district health management team can access compiled information using a computer (Refer to Section 9 of the 3rd  Edition Malawi IDSR TG on eIDSR on more countries specific examples). In Malawi district team collects the data from the communities and health facilities in its catchment area and merge, aggregate, send and reports to the central level. ",booklet2,821
750,752,Adequate data protection and security must be ensured. Care must be taken not to leave documents containing personal health information related to notifiable conditions on work desks or anywhere they may be visible to unauthorized people.

765,767,"At each level where data is received (health facility, district or national), the IDSR focal person should always liaise with the Assistant Statistician to extract the priority IDSR diseases/events from the register and enter correctly into aggregated IDSR reporting forms while listing data from all the reporting sites. Troubleshooting and cleaning data prior to analysis is an important data management practice. Disease trends and maps will not be accurate if information about number of cases, time of onset, or geographic location of cases are missing. Use opportunities during supervisory visits to sensitize clinicians and laboratory staff about the importance of quality practices for recording patient information in patient log-books/register or reporting forms. Emphasize that patient logs are sources of data for reporting public health information and may play a role in detecting an unusual event or otherwise undetected public health issues.",booklet2,957
766,768,"Ensure that Assistant Statistician or IDSR focal person knows the algorithm for reporting including reporting levels. Ensure also, they are recording rumours in the rumours log books.  The registers which are normally used in Malawi are the OPD and IPD registers and the IDSR Focal person should always liaise with the Assistant Statistician to extract the priority disease of IDSR from the registers.",booklet2,401

They will not know if data are missing or if no cases were reported. Zero reporting allows the next level to know that surveillance did not detect a case of the particular disease or condition.",booklet2,378
770,772,Ensure that weekly totals include only those cases or deaths actually reported for that Epidemiological week (Monday to Sunday). Late reports from previous weeks should be entered with the relevant week and totals updated accordingly.,booklet2,234

774,776,Ensure update of information on laboratory results is done by linking to the respective case record unique identifier,booklet2,117
775,777,"Once the data have been received and entered into the aggregate forms, review them carefully to ensure no mistakes were made during entry.

An attack rate describes the risk of getting the disease during a specified period, such as the duration of an outbreak. Attack rate is defined as the frequency with which an event (such as a new case of illness) occurs in a population at risk over a specified period, and is usually calculated in an outbreak scenario. It is expressed per population at risk; for example: 4.5/100 000 population. ",booklet2,501

878,880,3.3 Compare analysis results with thresholds for public health action,booklet2,69
879,881,"Thresholds are markers that indicate unusual situation and require that something should happen or change. They help surveillance and program managers answer the question, “When should I take action, and what will that action be?” Information on establishing thresholds is in Section 4.1 of these 3rd Edition Malawi IDSR Technical Guidelines.",booklet2,342
880,882,Thresholds are based on information from two different sources:,booklet2,63
881,883,"In some instances, there might be already a situation analysis which has been done to describe the risks for occurrence of a particular diseases, and who the people at risk might be and there is already a described action that needs to be done once the risks have been identified to prevent a wider outbreak",booklet2,307
882,884,International recommendations from technical and disease control program experts.,booklet2,81
883,885,"These guidelines discuss two types of thresholds: an alert threshold and an epidemic threshold. Not every disease or condition uses both types of thresholds, although each disease or condition has a point where a problem must be reported and an action taken.",booklet2,258
884,886,"An alert threshold suggests to health staff and the surveillance team that further investigation is needed. Depending on the disease or condition, an alert threshold is reached when there is one suspected case (as for an epidemic-prone disease or for a disease targeted for elimination or eradication) or when there is an unexplained increase for any disease or unusual pattern seen over a period of time in weekly or monthly summary reporting. ",booklet2,445
885,887,"Action (epidemic) threshold triggers a definite response. It marks the specific data or investigation finding that alerts an action beyond confirming or clarifying the problem. Possible actions include communicating laboratory confirmation to affected health centres, implementing an emergency response such as an immunization activity, community awareness campaign, or improved infection control practices in the health care setting. Several thresholds have been proposed for action based on disease surveillance findings. For rare diseases or diseases targeted for eradication, detection of a single case suggests an epidemic. In such situations, one case is unusual and is a serious event. This is because these rare or targeted diseases have the potential for rapid transmission or high case fatality rates.",booklet2,811
886,888,"In other situations, a number of cases will trigger a response. For example, the epidemic threshold for bacterial meningitis in countries of the meningitis belt is 10 suspected cases per 30,000 - 100,000 inhabitants per week and under 30,000 inhabitants is 5 suspected cases in one week or doubling of the number of cases in a three-week period (Minimum of 2 cases in one week), and the alert threshold is 3 suspected cases per 30,000 - 100,000 inhabitants per week and under 30,000 inhabitants is 2 suspected cases per week or an increased incidence compared to previous non-epidemic years (Source: Weekly Epidemiological Record No 51/52, 577-588, 19 December 2014( http://www.who.int/wer).",booklet2,691
887,889,The epidemic threshold for malaria in some countries is 3rd Quartile of confirmed malaria cases for the past 5 years; Alert threshold is 2nd quartile/Median of confirmed malaria cases,booklet2,183
888,890,"In practice, the national level is responsible for communicating the thresholds for priority diseases to all reporting sites in the health system. This facilitates use of surveillance information for action at the level where it is collected. Periodically, surveillance thresholds are assessed and reset at national or international levels according to the observed trends of the diseases, events or conditions under surveillance.",booklet2,430

52,54,FOREWORD,booklet5,8
53,55,"In 1998, the World Health Organization (WHO) Regional Office for Africa (AFRO) together with technical partners adopted a strategy for developing and implementing comprehensive public health surveillance and response systems in African countries, initially called integrated disease surveillance (IDS). However, to highlight the linkage between surveillance and response, the strategy was later re-named Integrated Disease Surveillance and Response (IDSR). Malawi adopted the first edition of the IDSR technical guidelines in 2005. Since then, there has been an investment in human and material resources to strengthen capacities for public health surveillance systems in order to prevent, timely detect, and respond appropriately to public health threats. ",booklet5,757
54,56,"The coming into force, in 2007, of the International Health Regulations (IHR 2005), the emergence of new diseases, conditions and events and the formulation of strategies for disaster risk management (DRM) resulted in the need to revise the first edition of the IDSR technical guidelines. There was also the need to address the increasing burden of non-communicable diseases. Furthermore, there was the need to strengthen community-based surveillance for early detection, rapid confirmation and response to public health threats. Moreover, alignment with broader system strengthening objectives was required. Hence, in 2010, the second edition of the IDSR guidelines was developed, which Malawi adopted in 2014.",booklet5,711
55,57,"Diseases, both communicable and non-communicable, continue to be a major cause of morbidity and mortality in Malawi and in the Africa region as a whole despite the advanced global knowledge on how to detect and control them. Of late, non-communicable diseases are increasingly becoming a major public health problem in the country. The majority of non-communicable diseases are preventable but multiple factors which include environmental, social, and economic determinants hamper effective prevention and control of these diseases. As one way of addressing these problems, the Ministry of Health is strengthening the disease surveillance systems using new guidelines for the IDSR revised by the WHO-AFRO in 2018.",booklet5,713
56,58,"This Third Edition has now been reviewed to include the new developments. The manual contains practical guidelines for use as a general reference for surveillance activities at all levels; and as a resource material for developing training, supervision and evaluation of surveillance activities.",booklet5,295
57,59,"It is worth noting that, many public health events (PHEs) and emergencies and their associated risk factors could be prevented or their effects mitigated. However, the health systems in most countries remain inadequate. To avert and mitigate the effects of future health security risks and emergencies, Malawi intends to implement these IDSR technical guidelines. These guidelines recommend thresholds for action for priority diseases, conditions, public health events and responding to alerts. Using these action thresholds can be lifesaving.",booklet5,543
58,60,"Finally, I appeal to you all to ensure that the third edition of the IDSR technical guidelines are implemented within a broader context of health system strengthening; better coordination between human and animal health surveillance and other sectors involved in One Health approach; improved use of laboratory network capacity in surveillance and response; and better community engagement in public health interventions.

78,80,HEALTH SYSTEM CONTEXTS ,booklet5,23
79,81,10. Introduction ,booklet5,17
80,82,"Humanitarian emergencies  have major implications on the populations where they occur and on their health services including surveillance systems (WHO, 2012). Emergencies typically result in population displacement to congested settings where access to basic needs like water, food, shelter, and other social services are constrained. These conditions thus increase the risk of death from common epidemic and endemic diseases. ",booklet5,427
81,83,"Consequently, effective public health surveillance and outbreak response is a priority during public health emergencies in affected populations. Due to the disruption of health and other social services during the emergencies, the routine IDSR system need to be enhanced to meet the public health surveillance and outbreak response needs in humanitarian contexts. In these settings, IDSR should be tailored to the prevailing context to meet the additional emergency needs.",booklet5,472
82,84,"In these settings, an Enhanced IDSR system should be established to address the humanitarian emergency. The system set up should be based on the IDSR strategy, structures, tools, guidelines and resources while ensuring the flexibility required in addressing the surveillance and response needs of affected populations in emergency situations. This should be done within the existing national IDSR system. ",booklet5,405
83,85," This section introduces key principles of implementing IDSR in complex humanitarian emergencies. This will involve enhancing IDSR core functions to ensure early detection, assessment and response to acute public health events. For more detailed description, please refer to the WHO document on early detection, assessment and response to acute public health events- implementation of early warning and response with focus on event-based surveillance, (WHO, 2014).",booklet5,464
84,86,10.1 Health information system in emergency contexts ,booklet5,53
85,87,"Acute and protracted crises have major immediate and long-term effects on population health and health systems. Conflicts and disasters create disruptions in the overall functionality of the health system. The routine IDSR system may be underperforming or disrupted. Thus, there is a need to tailor the IDSR to adequately meet surveillance information needs of a humanitarian emergency. Examples of such humanitarian emergencies include: armed conflict, famine, natural disasters and other major emergencies.",booklet5,508
86,88,10.1.1 Key definitions in Emergency contexts ,booklet5,45
87,89,10.1.1.1 Disaster,booklet5,17
88,90,"A serious disruption of the functioning of a community or a society causing widespread human, material, economic or environmental losses which exceed the ability of the affected community or society to cope using its own resources (International Strategy for Disaster Reduction [ISDR], 2009). A disaster is also defined as a situation or event, which overwhelms local capacity, necessitating additional national or international assistance (Center for Research on Environmental Decisions [CRED, ReliefWeb, 2008).",booklet5,512
89,91,10.1.1.2 Humanitarian emergency,booklet5,31
90,92,"A situation where the basic human needs of a population are threatened and therefore requires extra-ordinary measures and urgent action (ReliefWeb, 2008).",booklet5,154
91,93,10.1.1.3 Complex emergency ,booklet5,27
92,94,"A humanitarian crisis in a country, region or society where there is total or considerable breakdown of authority resulting from internal or external conflict and which requires an international response that goes beyond the mandate or capacity of any single and/or ongoing UN country programme (ReliefWeb, 2008).",booklet5,313
93,95,10.2 Early Warning and Response ,booklet5,32
94,96,"Early warning is an organized mechanism to detect as early as possible any abnormal occurrence or any divergence from the usual or normally observed frequency of diseases, conditions and events. It relies on a network of people either from functional static or mobile health facilities/clinics that are responsible for the collection, investigation, reporting, analysis and dissemination of information from the field to the central level for appropriate action.",booklet5,462
95,97, 10.2.1 Why is it needed? ,booklet5,26
96,98,"The enhanced surveillance needs during humanitarian emergencies demand that surveillance systems are in place for systematic collection, collation, analysis, and interpretation of data, and dissemination of information to facilitate public health response to prevent excess morbidity, mortality and disability (WHO, 2009).  Consequently, during the acute phase of a humanitarian emergency, IDSR should be modified as soon as possible to focus on priority health problems during the emergency phase. The tailored IDSR should focus on diseases, conditions or events for a given emergency context and should be flexible enough  to respond to other emerging public health priorities (WHO, 2009). ",booklet5,692
97,99,"During emergencies, populations are more vulnerable to morbidity, mortality and disability resulting from endemic and epidemic prone diseases. Thus, IDSR should be enhanced within 3-10 days of grading the public health emergency to facilitate rapid detection and response to disease outbreaks and public health events (WHO, 2009). Ultimately, this will contribute to the overall goal of reducing avoidable mortality, morbidity, and disability during humanitarian crises (WHO, 2009b). ",booklet5,484
98,100,10.2.2 What are the objectives of tailoring IDSR to emergency context?,booklet5,70
99,101,"The main objective is to rapidly detect and control acute public health events of any origin, with particular attention to prioritized health risks. The aim is to increase sensitivity of detection, quality of risk assessment, and timeliness and effectiveness of the response to acute public health risks in order to minimize the negative health consequences to the affected population.",booklet5,385
100,102,The specific objectives are to: ,booklet5,32
101,103,Detect early an acute public health events and health risks; ,booklet5,61
102,104,Ensure immediate communication of information from local and intermediate levels to national levels as well as from any source identified at the national level; ,booklet5,161
103,105,Verify the initial information (i.e. signal); ,booklet5,46
104,106,"Document the nature of the event through investigation, characterization, etiological confirmation; ",booklet5,100
105,107,Perform risk assessment to determine the level of risk posed by the detected event; ,booklet5,84
106,108,Ensure immediate alert mechanisms from national and/or intermediate levels to local levels; ,booklet5,92
107,109,"Ensure prompt investigation as necessary and implement an adequate response through mitigation and control measures, as required by the continuous risk assessment; and ",booklet5,168
108,110,Alert and maintain communication/coordination with national/international stakeholders ,booklet5,87
109,111,10.2.3 Critical components,booklet5,26
110,112,"During humanitarian crises, all functional static and mobile health facilities/clinics including Internally Displaced Persons (IDP)/refugee camp clinics that provide curative, disease prevention and health promotion interventions should be included in the IDSR network to enhance the sensitivity of the system (WHO, 2009). Depending on the extent of the crisis, the surveillance network may include government and/or partner-supported clinics (WHO, 2012). ",booklet5,456
111,113,"To ensure efficiency, the data collection and analysis processes need to be systematized and formalized. Epidemic intelligence should be based on the two main IDSR event detection systems, namely: indicator-based surveillance (immediate and weekly reporting of data aggregated by health facilities) and event-based surveillance, which is the organized collection, monitoring, assessment and interpretation of mainly unstructured ad hoc information regarding health events or risks. These complementary systems increase the sensitivity  of IDSR to ensure timely detection and verification of outbreaks, and effective monitoring of morbidity patterns (WHO, 2012)",booklet5,660
112,114,10.3 Implementation of IDSR in humanitarian emergencies,booklet5,55
113,115,10.3.1 Rapid assessment of the situation,booklet5,40
114,116,"During the acute phase of the emergency it is helpful to undertake a systematic assessment of the risk of acute public health events. This involves gauging both the likelihood of a disease occurring and its eventual impact. The assessment can identify the epidemic-prone diseases that have the potential to cause the greatest amount of morbidity and mortality in the affected population, and determine the geographical scope of surveillance. The assessment is also done on the status of key surveillance infrastructure, including existing surveillance capacity, identification of resource needs for IDSR implementation, including staff with relevant skills, communication and IT equipment laboratory support and transport. The assessment should be based on consensus-building, analysis of existing data, establishment of working groups and conducting in-depth interviews, as required. It should be based on an all-hazards approach and be repeated as the emergency evolves, to account for changes.",booklet5,996
115,117,10.3.2 Gap analysis,booklet5,19
116,118,"The gap analysis should be performed to complement the situation analysis and the assessment of the surveillance system. It aims to assess the specific needs and environment, and to review the strengths, weaknesses, threats and opportunities around the existing national surveillance system in order to identify available resources to reinforce IDSR. Gap analysis does not require a new or additional formal evaluation be carried out. The results of previous evaluations of the surveillance system can be reused for the gap analysis. If not all information is available, focus groups or in-depth interviews with stakeholders at all levels of the surveillance system could be considered.",booklet5,686
117,119,10.3.3 Prioritization,booklet5,21
118,120,"In order to ensure the most efficient use of resources, the strategy should be based on a prioritization exercise, the results of the gap analysis and the list of priority events for surveillance. For each selected disease, condition or event surveillance objectives need to be specified based on the country’s context.

72,74,FOREWORD ,booklet4,9
73,75,"In 1998, the World Health Organization (WHO) Regional Office for Africa (AFRO) together with technical partners adopted a strategy for developing and implementing comprehensive public health surveillance and response systems in African countries, initially called integrated disease surveillance (IDS). However, to highlight the linkage between surveillance and response, the strategy was later re-named Integrated Disease Surveillance and Response (IDSR). Malawi adopted the first edition of the IDSR technical guidelines in 2005. Since then, there has been an investment in human and material resources to strengthen capacities for public health surveillance systems in order to prevent, timely detect, and respond appropriately to public health threats. ",booklet4,757
74,76,"The coming into force, in 2007, of the International Health Regulations (IHR 2005), the emergence of new diseases, conditions and events and the formulation of strategies for disaster risk management (DRM) resulted in the need to revise the first edition of the IDSR technical guidelines. There was also the need to address the increasing burden of non-communicable diseases. Furthermore, there was the need to strengthen community-based surveillance for early detection, rapid confirmation and response to public health threats. Moreover, alignment with broader system strengthening objectives was required. Hence, in 2010, the second edition of the IDSR guidelines was developed, which Malawi subsequently adapted in 2014. ",booklet4,725
75,77,"Diseases, both communicable and non-communicable, continue to be a major cause of morbidity and mortality in Malawi and in the Africa region as a whole despite the advanced global knowledge on how to detect and control them. Of late, non-communicable diseases are increasingly becoming a major public health problem in the country. The majority of non-communicable diseases are preventable but multiple factors which include environmental, social, and economic determinants hamper effective prevention and control of these diseases. Emerging and re-emerging diseases and conditions pose a threat to the country’s health security. ",booklet4,630
76,78,"Responding to health emergencies remains a major challenge, as shown by recent health emergencies in the country as well as the African region, the unprecedented Ebola Virus Disease of 2014, the ongoing Coronavirus Disease of 2019 Pandemic. Specifically, challenges in capacity to prevent, detect and respond to public health threats have been identified.. As one way of addressing these problems, the Ministry of Health is strengthening the disease surveillance systems using the Third Edition of the guidelines for IDSR as revised by the WHO-AFRO in 2018 and adapted to our context in 2020. ",booklet4,593
77,79,"It is worth noting that, many Public Health Events (PHEs) and emergencies and their associated risk factors could be prevented or their effects mitigated. However, the health systems in most countries remain inadequate.  To avert and mitigate the effects of future health security risks and emergencies, Malawi intends to  implement these IDSR technical guidelines. These guidelines recommend thresholds for action for priority diseases, conditions, public health events and responding to alerts. Using these action thresholds can be lifesaving. Therefore, it is important that we scale up and fully implement this third edition of the IDSR technical guidelines in the country as they explicitly describe what needs to be established at each level of the health system in order to detect, confirm and respond to diseases, conditions and health events that are responsible for  illness, deaths and disability in local communities. ",booklet4,930
78,80,"The cost of good public health surveillance as a public health good is relatively very low compared to many other strategies. Let us all embrace these IDSR technical guidelines to strengthen capacities for preparedness, alert and response for health security in the country. ",booklet4,275
79,81,"These guidelines are to be used by all relevant multisectoral stakeholders at all levels as general reference for surveillance activities, set of standard definitions for threshold levels that initiate action for responding to specific diseases, stand-alone reference for level-specific responsibilities, resource for developing training, supervision, monitoring and evaluation of surveillance activities, and as a guide for improving early detection and response of epidemic prone diseases. ",booklet4,492
80,82,"Finally, I appeal to you all to ensure that the third edition of the IDSR technical guidelines are implemented within a broader context of health system strengthening; better coordination between human and animal health surveillance and other sectors involved in One Health approach; improved use of laboratory network capacity in surveillance and response; and better community engagement in public health interventions.

100,102,"Monitoring of surveillance and response systems refers to the routine and continuous tracking of planned surveillance activities (for example, reports are received on time), while evaluation which is done periodically (for example annually), assesses whether surveillance and response objectives have been achieved. Both monitoring and evaluation helps to understand if the system has been working effectively. By evaluating information regularly, for example, at the end of a year, supervisors can decide if surveillance and response objectives have been achieved and if they are of high quality. Through supervision, supervisors and health professional work together to review progress, identify problems, decide what has caused the problem and develop feasible solutions. Sustainable supervision and feedback, has been shown to contribute to improved performance of national diseases surveillance systems. ",booklet4,909
101,103,This section will describe how to routinely monitor and annually evaluate the performance of the surveillance system and specific disease or public health events control and prevention programs. The section will concentrate on the core surveillance functions described in the introduction section. The section will also describe how supervision and provision of feedback are key for the improvement of the surveillance and response systems. ,booklet4,441

123,125,"Section 3 of Booklet 2 describes how each month, the health staffs responsible for surveillance at the health facility and at the district level review and analyse the data reported during the month. Conclusions are made about: ",booklet4,228
124,126,"·     The timeliness and completeness of reporting from each level, and ",booklet4,72
125,127,"·     The quality of routine prevention and control activities taking place so that when problems are detected, districts respond with appropriate action. ",booklet4,155
126,128,The same information can also be used during supervisions to routinely monitor and annually evaluate: ,booklet4,102

130,132,"When problems are detected in the surveillance and response system, action can be taken to strengthen the system. By giving feedback to the health workers for the corrections which have been identified, it is more likely that results will show the desired outcomes. For example, use the monthly monitoring data to do an evaluation at the end of the year. Questions to help evaluate include: ",booklet4,391

134,136,8.1 Identify targets and indicators ,booklet4,36
135,137,Using indicators can be helpful in measuring the extent of achievement for a particular program or activity. Indicators are signs of progress – they are used to determine whether the programme/intervention is on its way to achieving its objectives and goal. This achievement is then compared to overall recommended performance standard. Some disease specific surveillance indicators also exist and can be used to monitor quality of the surveillance system e.g. AFP and measles. ,booklet4,478
136,138,"Indicators are also used to assess the performance of surveillance system whether it is reaching its targets and objectives. For example, a district may have a goal of reaching 100% completeness of reporting by a certain period. An indicator can be developed to measure the proportion or percentage of facilities that are reporting. This proportion is then compared with the desired goal or target, and can be used to evaluate progress and, therefore, the quality of the service or activity. ",booklet4,492
137,139,8.1.1 Use indicators in accordance with national goals and specific plans ,booklet4,74
138,140,Use indicators according to national goals and specific plans to improve IDSR activities in a district. Select the indicators that are most relevant to the district’s plan for improving surveillance this year and that will provide information that the district can use. ,booklet4,270
139,141,8.1.2 Select data for measuring the indicators ,booklet4,47
140,142,"After you have selected relevant indicators, specify the numerator and the denominator. For example, if a district objective is for all health facilities to keep trend lines for selected priority diseases, the numerator and denominator are defined as follows: ",booklet4,260
141,143,Indicator:                The proportion of health facilities in the district that keep trend ,booklet4,94

150,152,"The indicators related to the core functions measure the processes and outputs from the surveillance system. In the introduction section, core surveillance functions were described and you can refer to the table of core surveillance functions for each level. This sub-section will describe the key indicators at various levels as regard to the core functions. The core functions are described here briefly, but described in detail in Annexe 8C, whereby there are indicators for each core function (See Annexes 8A, 8B, 8D and 8E). ",booklet4,530
151,153,The core functions are; ,booklet4,24
152,154,(i)  Identify cases and public health events ,booklet4,45
153,155,"Case detection is the process of identifying cases and outbreaks. Case detection can be through the formal health system, private health systems or community structures. Case definitions and a functioning rumour verification system are vital for case and outbreak detection. Once a case has been identified, there is register (Outpatient or In-patient register, clinical cases register etc.) where these cases have to be recorded. In many countries, health workers use the registers to extract the IDSR priority diseases. ",booklet4,522
154,156, Monitoring indicators should be established to monitor this core surveillance function.     ,booklet4,93
155,157,Examples of indicators could be ,booklet4,32
156,158,·       Proportion of health facilities that have standardized registers for recording diseases. Further assessment could also be done to examine the validity and quality of information recorded as well as factors that affect the registration ,booklet4,243

158,160,(ii) Report Cases and Events ,booklet4,29
159,161,Reporting refers to the process by which surveillance data moves through the surveillance system from the point of generation to the next level. ,booklet4,145
160,162,"It also refers to the process of reporting suspected and confirmed outbreaks as well as notifying under the IHR 2005 of PHEIC using the decision instrument mentioned in Section 2. Different reporting systems may be in existence depending on the type of data and information being reported, purpose and urgency of relaying the information and where the data/information is being reported. Timely submission of data is critical for prompt outbreak detection and response to prevent widespread outbreaks. Health facilities should therefore strive to submit reports on time as prescribed in the IDSR Technical guidelines Booklet 2, Section 2. ",booklet4,639

The updated Morbidity Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR), updated guidelines for evaluating public health surveillance systems produced by the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the framework for evaluating public health surveillance systems for early detection of outbreaks are some of the tools which can be used to evaluate comprehensively surveillance systems (CDC, 2001). Countries, which already have a Field Epidemiology Training Programs (FETP) or equivalent applied epidemiology program, should use residents to assist in evaluation of the surveillance and response systems of IDSR and other disease surveillance systems. ",booklet4,842
209,211,8.3.1 Monitoring the timeliness and completeness of monthly reporting ,booklet4,70
210,212,"An important indicator of a quality reporting system is the timeliness and completeness of reporting at each level. When reports are sent and received on time, the possibility of detecting a problem and conducting a prompt and effective response is greater. If they are incomplete, then the information cannot describe the problem. If reports are late, or are not submitted, the aggregated information for the district (or other administrative area) will not be accurate. Outbreaks can go undetected, and other opportunities to respond to public health problems will be missed. ",booklet4,578
211,213,8.3.1.1 Timeliness ,booklet4,19
212,214,The single most important measure of timeliness is whether data are submitted in time to begin investigations and implement control measures. Timeliness of reporting should be measured against standards developed by each country in accordance with the timelines set by WHO AFRO. Important aspects of timelines of reporting in a communicable disease surveillance system include: ,booklet4,378
213,215,"·       timeliness of immediate notification, i.e. within 24 hours ",booklet4,67
214,216,·       timeliness of weekly reporting ,booklet4,39

216,218,(i)       Monitor detection and notification of immediately reportable diseases or events ,booklet4,90
217,219,"Monitor how well the system is able to detect immediately notifiable diseases or events. Monitor the interval between the onset of the first known case and when the case was seen in the health facility. If this interval is too long, it will seriously affect the health outcome of individual patients and will alter the spread of the outbreak. ",booklet4,343
218,220,"Other intervals to monitor for detection of immediately reportable diseases include monitoring reporting from the community to the health facility and to the district (within 24 hours of onset of illness), from the health facility to the district (within 24 hours) and from the time the threshold is reached to a concrete response (within 48 hours). ",booklet4,350
219,221,(ii)     Timeliness of weekly and monthly reporting ,booklet4,52
220,222,"If you routinely record and review the dates on which reports are received, the effectiveness of the system can be assessed easily each month during the analysis of routine and case-based data. You can use a monitoring tool such as the one in Annex 8F to monitor timeliness in your district. For example, use the record of reports received to: ",booklet4,344
221,223,·       Measure how many reporting units submitted reports for a given week/ month against the number of units expected to report ,booklet4,130

225,227,8.2.1.2 Completeness ,booklet4,21
226,228,Completeness in surveillance can have varying dimensions and may include the following: ,booklet4,88
227,229,(i)      Completeness of reporting sites submitting surveillance forms: ,booklet4,72
228,230,Completeness of reporting sites refers to the proportion of reporting sites that submitted the surveillance report irrespective of the time when the report was submitted. Computing completeness of reporting sites for each of the surveillance reports can: ,booklet4,255
229,231,·     provide a trend analysis on completeness of reporting for each of the surveillance reports over a period of time; and assist in identifying how each site is performing ,booklet4,174
230,232,·     It can also further trigger investigation for reasons for poor performances and possibly help to identify solutions to correct poor performance. ,booklet4,151
231,233,(ii)    Completeness of case reporting ,booklet4,39
232,234,Completeness of case reporting refers to the match between the number of cases reported and the actual number of cases. This can be obtained by comparing the number of the reportable conditions reported to the next higher level over a period with the number of cases recorded in the patient register over the same period. ,booklet4,322
233,235,(iii)  Completeness of surveillance data ,booklet4,41
234,236,Completeness of surveillance data is the match between the expected data requirement and what is reported. The following questions are useful in determining completeness of surveillance data and its implications on public health actions. ,booklet4,238
235,237,"·     Are all the data on each of the required variables in a surveillance form collected, registered, validated and compiled? ",booklet4,127

238,240,·     How can this problem be resolved? ,booklet4,40
239,241,8.3.1.3 Identify problems and take action ,booklet4,42
240,242,"If the monitoring information shows that a health facility or other reporting unit has not provided a report, or if the report is not on time, contact the surveillance focal point at the facility. Work with the designated staff to identify what has caused the problem and develop solutions together (for example, find out if a reliable supply of forms or other reporting method such as text messaging or radiophone is available). Explain to the facility staff the benefits of collecting good quality data and reporting it in a timely manner. For example, this can help them to detect outbreaks, improves medicines and supplies forecasting, and improves overall health facility management. ",booklet4,689
241,243,"Additionally, ask if a new staff person has started at the facility and is yet to receive orientation on the procedure for reporting. Or find out if health facility staff receives feedback about case reports they have generated and that there are resources available to take action as a result of the information. ",booklet4,314
242,244,"Make plans with the reporting unit to find solutions for improving the situation. Explain that, when information is complete, the district can assist health staff more efficiently with planning responses and carrying them out. For example, if lack of supplies is a problem, the district can use the reporting information to advocate with higher levels in the system. ",booklet4,367
243,245,8.3.1.4 Report timeliness and completeness to other levels ,booklet4,59
244,246,"When routine reports or line-listed records of the number of cases are sent to the district or national level, also send the necessary data for timeliness and completeness. This will help the other levels understand the situation more clearly and evaluate the quality of the data that is being sent. For example, if the report to the national level states that two cases of measles were detected during the month, it should also include information about the number of health facilities that have reported. It will make a difference to the other levels when they evaluate the information if the 2 cases occurred with only 20% rather than 100% of the units reporting. ",booklet4,667

",booklet4,353
253,255,Qualitative feedback from volunteers and the community is an essential part of contextualizing and understanding quantitative CBS data. A system should be in place from the beginning to capture community and volunteers’ feedback and this may involve one or more of the following approaches; ,booklet4,291

273,275,"·       Decide how often to monitor health staff performance. For example, a district may decide to conduct a supervisory visit at least 4 times a year for each health facility. In some countries, depending on resources, supervisory visits take place more often (monthly, for example). ",booklet4,286
274,276,·       Ask health facility supervisors to make a schedule of the supervision they will conduct over the next year in their own facilities and to any community sites that report to the facility. ,booklet4,195

278,280,"Each health facility has unique problems and priorities that require specific problem solving and corrections. To maintain the positive motivation of the health facility staff for making the improvements, consider developing a graduated checklist to guide the supervisory visit. The items listed in a graduated checklist (such as the one in Annex 8G) are some of the examples of achievements that a health facility can be evaluated on. Always refer to Annexes (8A-8F) and look for additional examples to evaluate for each core surveillance function at the health facility level.  For example, when the facility has achieved one objective (using standard case definitions consistently, for example), work with health facility staff to include the next indicator or item for monitoring performance such as using thresholds for action. Revise the supervisory checklist accordingly. Use it during future visits to help health staff monitor their activities and progress towards an improved system. ",booklet4,994
279,281,"During the visit, use a checklist to monitor how well health staffs are carrying out the recommended surveillance functions. For example, a district surveillance officer visiting a health facility for a supervisory visit should verify the following: ",booklet4,250

318,320,"If the facility does not receive information from the next level about how the data were used or what the data meant, health staff may think that their reporting is not important. As a result, future reporting may not be as reliable because health staff will not know if the information they sent to other levels was important or necessary. They will have a good understanding of the health situation at their own level, but they will not have the information they need for characterizing the situation at a district or national level. At the community level, communication includes building relationships, communicate and coordination with other community key informants, resource persons and existing formal and informal networks for information dissemination and reporting. ",booklet4,777
319,321,"Feedback may be written, such as a monthly newsletter/bulletin, emails, WhatsApp, SMS or periodic official information like publications or it may be given verbally through telephone call or periodic meetings. Although this section focuses on district level feedback, this can also be applied in health facility and national levels. Feedback may also be given during supportive supervision carried out by Districts to health facilities, to Districts or National to districts. The supervision can be on performance of health programs and feedback can be provided during these visits. ",booklet4,583
320,322,(a)     Develop and disseminate routine epidemiological bulletins ,booklet4,66
321,323,"Feedback should also be given periodically of IDSR reportable diseases/conditions, and this can be through weekly, monthly or quarterly epidemiological bulletins. The bulletins provide information on disease patterns and achievement of program objectives in the country. They are usually brief and are important for reaching policy makers, legislators, development partners, program technical staff and stakeholders. As a minimum, they contain: ",booklet4,445
322,324,·       A summary table with the number of reported cases and deaths to date for each priority disease ,booklet4,103
323,325,·       A commentary or message on a given disease or topic ,booklet4,60
324,326,"·       Any relevant social, economic or cultural information or data on the context that can lead to the creation of real intelligence regarding an event. Annex 8H shows examples of an epidemiological bulletin  ",booklet4,212
325,327,(b) Develop information summary sheets ,booklet4,39
326,328,An information summary sheet is a report that presents data and its interpretation in a table or other graphic format. For example: ,booklet4,132
327,329,"·         At a staff meeting, or during a supervisory visit, give a verbal report or comment about the data that were reported by the health facility during a given period. ",booklet4,173
328,330,"·         Display the data in a simple table. Sit with the health staff and show them the data. Talk together about the likely conclusions that can be drawn. Consider conclusions not only for the health facility, but also for the district as a whole. ",booklet4,251
329,331,"·         Prepare a single sheet with a simple table that shows how the data reported for this period are different from the data reported for some other period or target population. For example, show the number of cases of diarrhoea with dehydration in children less than 5 years of age from the same period last year. Compare them with a corresponding period this year, after a safe water project was implemented in a high-risk area, for example, use the summary sheets to support requests made to higher levels for additional funds, supplies and resources. ",booklet4,560
330,332,(c) Develop district newsletters ,booklet4,33
331,333,The purpose of a district newsletter is to provide shorter updates than those provided in a more detailed feedback bulletin. The district newsletter is useful for informing and motivating health staff. The target audience for a newsletter could be health staff in the district. The newsletter can be 2 to 4 pages long and produced simply with a computer entered text. ,booklet4,368
332,334,Examples of articles that could be carried in a newsletter are: ,booklet4,64
333,335,·         Summary of national or district data for a given priority disease ,booklet4,76

339,341,8.6 Evaluate effectiveness of the performance of IDSR strategy ,booklet4,63
340,342,"The purpose of evaluation of a surveillance system is to assess the effectiveness of the system and response system in terms of timeliness, quality of data, preparedness, case management, overall performance and using the indicators to identify gaps or areas that could be strengthened. A comprehensive evaluation should thus include the surveillance system and if already available the IDSR Implementation Plan. The evaluation of the surveillance system should: ",booklet4,463
341,343,·       Show to what extent the desired outputs and outcomes are achieved; ,booklet4,75
342,344,"·       Provide explanations for achievements, disparities and failures; ",booklet4,73

344,346,·       Demonstrate the extent to which the overall surveillance objectives are achieved. ,booklet4,90
345,347,"Depending on the development status of surveillance in a district, select indicators for evaluation that will provide information that relates to the district’s priorities and objectives for the year. ",booklet4,201
346,348,"If there is already an IDSR implementation plan with clearly defined objectives, then it is appropriate to conduct mid-term and end-of-term evaluations. Otherwise surveillance systems should be evaluated every 2, 3 or 5 years. ",booklet4,227
347,349,Key steps in evaluation include: ,booklet4,33
348,350,8.6.1 Define your objectives ,booklet4,29
349,351,"·       Objectives should be simple, measurable, attainable, realistic, and time-bound (SMART). ",booklet4,96
350,352,8.6.2 Development of evaluation indicators ,booklet4,43
351,353,"·       Indicators should be identified for each of the evaluation objectives, and should be harmonized as much as possible with the monitoring indicators. ",booklet4,156
352,354,8.6.3 Development of evaluation methods and tools ,booklet4,50
353,355,"·       Based on these indicators, an evaluation protocol should be developed describing how the evaluation will be conducted, methods, target group, data sources, data collection methods, and plan for data analysis and utilization ",booklet4,232
354,356,8.6.4 Identify people to conduct the evaluation ,booklet4,48
355,357,"·       Determine who will be the evaluators; people within the districts, people outside the district, or a mixture of people including and partners/donors. Depending on the scope of the evaluation, its purpose and the available resources, a decision should be made during the planning stage on who should undertake them. ",booklet4,323
356,358,"To ensure objectivity and transparency during the evaluation process, a blend of self-internal evaluations and external evaluations should be conducted periodically. ",booklet4,166
357,359,8.6.5 Conduct the evaluation ,booklet4,29
358,360,8.6.5.1 Compile and organize monitoring data and other results ,booklet4,63
359,361,"The district health office should summarize the surveillance data received from all health facilities in the catchment area, and submit the compiled report to the national level as appropriate. The submission of the report should not be delayed until reports from all health facilities are received. Submit all reports received on time. Late reports may be submitted when they arrive. Follow up with health facilities who did not report or who consistently provide late reports. ",booklet4,479
360,362,Help the health facility to solve any problems that prevent them from submitting their summary reports on time. Provide feedback to health facilities about the indicator results on a regular basis. Feedback is a positive tool for motivating health staff to provide information on time and contribute to the national reporting system. ,booklet4,334
361,363,"The national level should compile the surveillance data received from all the districts. It national level should look for epidemics that were not identified by the districts. Follow up with areas where reporting continues to be unreliable or does not happen at all. Support the districts in providing assistance to the health facilities when they evaluate the measurements and take action to improve the situation. Provide feedback to each of the levels (national, district, health facility and community). ",booklet4,508
362,364,"Use a monitoring chart such as the one on the next page to monitor performance of the indicators at your level. Share these results with the staff in your catchment level. Acknowledge successes and help health staff to maintain the positive progress. When problems occur, talk together about what is causing the problem and how it can be solved. Seek assistance of the next level as needed for obtaining additional help or resources. ",booklet4,434
363,365,Gather data from several sources. For example: ,booklet4,47
364,366,o   Review the objectives for the year listed in the district’s annual plan for improving surveillance and response. ,booklet4,117
365,367,"o   Gather the monthly summaries of cases and deaths reported to the district, spot maps, and other analysis results performed by the district. ",booklet4,144
366,368,o   Collect any results from special surveys or studies that were done in the district over the previous year. ,booklet4,111
367,369,o   Include case investigation forms and reports of outbreak response activities that took place in the district. ,booklet4,114
368,370,o   Gather summary information from the community and also from health staff ,booklet4,77
369,371,8.6.5.2 Analyse data ,booklet4,21
370,372,"As you evaluate the summary data for the year, some items to decide on are: ",booklet4,76
371,373,"o   Were the reports complete, on time and accurate? ",booklet4,53
372,374,"o   What were significant changes in disease or event trends during the year? If an increase occurred, was the problem identified? ",booklet4,131
373,375,"o   If additional cases are still occurring, why are they occurring? Where are they occurring? ",booklet4,95
374,376,o   Were appropriate and timely actions taken in response to the surveillance data? ,booklet4,84
375,377,o   Were supervisory visits conducted as planned and follow up tasks carried out as planned? ,booklet4,93
376,378,o   Did the community feel that response activities were successful? ,booklet4,69
377,379,o   Were any actions taken to address health staff requests or suggestions about services or surveillance? ,booklet4,107
378,380,o   Were appropriate measures taken to prevent similar events? ,booklet4,63
379,381,8.6.5.3 Identify problems and their causes ,booklet4,43
380,382,"If problems occurred, and the district did not meet an expected target, or reach a desired level of performance with any indicator, find out what caused the difference between what was planned and what actually occurred. If a problem is identified, talk with the district team and health facility staff to find out the possible causes of the problem. ",booklet4,351
381,383,8.6.6 Update plans for improvements to the IDSR system ,booklet4,55
382,384,Include in the district plan successful activities that should continue. Also include feasible solutions selected as a result of analysis of the year’s annual evaluation. Plan to implement the solution. For example: ,booklet4,216

515,517,"Electronic IDSR (eIDSR) is the system put in place by the Ministry of Health to use different sets of electronic tools, digital solutions, human capacity and processes according to the principles of IDSR to facilitate surveillance functions for public health monitoring and diseases prevention, prediction, detection, reporting and response. It is based on; ",booklet4,358

517,519,"·       Rapid collection, analysis, reporting and use of disease/events data in real-time for appropriate public health action. ",booklet4,128
518,520,"The use of paper-based tools for implementation of IDSR has been an instrumental strategy for strengthening public health surveillance in the African region since IDSR was adopted in 1998. With the adoption of the International Health Regulations IHR (2005), which requires countries to strengthen capacity for disease surveillance and response, application of electronic tools to enhance real-time surveillance can improve timeliness of outbreak detection. ",booklet4,458
519,521,"In recent years, technological and analytical innovations have emerged as an approach which can be used to facilitate rapid transmission of public health surveillance information, consequently aiding timely detection of and response to outbreaks and other public health events. The application of e-tools in the health sector has the potential to provide real-time validated data for public health surveillance, investigation and prompt outbreak response. eIDSR provides new opportunities for acceleration of the achievement of the IHR (2005) core capacities.  ",booklet4,561
520,522,9.1 eIDSR in the context of Malawi ,booklet4,35
521,523,"Malawi started the exploration and piloting of potential solution for eIDSR in 2015. Based on the second eIDSR (Argus) pilot and recent study results19, the country adopted the DHIS2 as the digital platform to facilitate the eIDSR functionalities with the One Health approach. The Ministry of Health started developing the national eIDSR central data system, namely One Health Surveillance Platform (OHSP) in 2019, using DHIS2 technology. The OHSP/DHIS2 was designed and developed in a way to be able to interoperate with the national HMIS/DHIS2 instance for needed surveillance data exchange. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the OHSP was leveraged to respond to the COVID-19 surveillance needs. The OHSP was rapidly customized and roll-out countrywide with supports from multiple partners in 2020. Acknowledging the needs of moving IDSR from paper system to digital solution, the ministry is continuing the OHSP enhancement and development work in the years to come. ",booklet4,966
522,524,9.2 eIDSR in the context of Health Management Information Systems (HMIS) ,booklet4,73
523,525,"HMIS is used by Malawi to facilitate routine collection of data to support planning, management and decision-making in the health service provision. HMIS routinely collect data about diseases, events and conditions, as well as other administrative and service provision data. The primary source of the data is the health facility Outpatient Department (OPD) or Inpatient Department (IPD) register. The Primary electronic platform of HMIS in Malawi is DHIS2. This open source platform is mostly used in low and middle-income countries. ",booklet4,535
524,526,"In both HMIS and eIDSR, the source data are derived from the health facility OPD, IPD or Community Health register. eIDSR is an enabling platform for reporting in real time for IDSR priority diseases.  In the eIDSR platform, there is an active and timely means of collection of data on IDSR priority diseases, and conditions which are extracted from either OPD or IPD registers including patients’ folders, and they are reported immediately or weekly or monthly. HMIS emphasizes on completeness of aggregate reports whereas the OHSP/eIDSR focusses on timeliness and it requires a lot of data transactions while concentrating on individual level data which requires confidentiality. Both systems need to be interoperable as some analysis requires availability of data from both systems. For instance, calculation of prevalence of Diarrhoea cases in Under 5 years old children indicator requires population data which is captured in HMIS. ",booklet4,937
525,527,9.3 eIDSR in the context of eHealth ,booklet4,36
526,528,"In 2013, the African region adopted an eHealth resolution (AFR/RC60/R3) to address the use of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) for health and health-related fields, including disease surveillance. In Malawi, the Ministry of Health instituted the Digital Health Division to coordinate and handle all issues related to health information systems including the development of the eHealth strategy and appropriate governance mechanisms. eHealth encompasses a range of services and systems, including; ",booklet4,513

528,530,"·       tele-health, which means transmission of health related services or information over the telecommunications infrastructure e.g. Chipatala Cha Pa Foni – CCPF, COVID19 Unstructured Supplementary Service Data – USSD 929 service. ",booklet4,234
529,531,·       e-learning which means utilizing technologies to access education outside of the traditional classroom e.g. TranSMART. ,booklet4,127
530,532,"·       m-health which is a general term for use of mobile phone and other wireless technologies in medical health e.g. Integrated Supportive Supervision – ISS, COVID19 WhatsApp chart box, RapidPro SMS. ",booklet4,203
531,533,"Member states echoed the same sentiment in the recent 71st World Health Assembly and unanimously agreed that digital health solutions should complement and enhance existing health service delivery models. Subsequently, they adopted the new resolution on Digital health which underscores the importance of nationally-supported digital health strategies, supporting and investing in the digital health enabling environment (including policy, standards, capacity, interoperability, privacy and security, and more), and transitioning to sustainability and government ownership.  ",booklet4,575
532,534,"Digital health or sometimes called eHealth provides cost-effective and secure use of ICTs in health and health-related fields. Digital health, as defined by the Broadband Commission for Sustainable Development, is an umbrella term that encompasses all concepts and activities at the intersection of health and information and communications technologies (ICTs). This includes the delivery of health information, using ICTs to improve public health services, and using health information systems to capture, store, manage or transmit information on patient health or health facility activities.  ICTs are defined as tools that facilitate communication and the processing and transmission of information by electronic means and these encompass a full range of tools like radio and television to telephones (fixed and mobile), computers, and the Internet. ",booklet4,853
533,535,"eIDSR, which is part of eHealth, is one of the essential innovations for fulfilment of the regional committee recommendations on use of information technology, which is core in the achievement of IHR (2005) requirements by countries. Standardization of electronic tools and sustained infrastructure across the region will promote easy generation and sharing of country and regional profiles of priority diseases, conditions and events. ",booklet4,436
534,536,9.4 Rationale of eIDSR ,booklet4,23
535,537,"The limitations with the traditional approach of IDSR data collection and transmission in Malawi, are attributed to the fact that manual procedures and paper methods are used to collect and transmit data. Submitting and transmitting the data on time is a challenge, as health workers have to travel long distances on difficult terrains to submit their files. This leads to delays in getting information on time for action, especially if there is a suspected outbreak. Some of the challenges associated with the paper system include scarcity of paper forms leading to less reporting of cases, huge costs of transporting the paper forms to Health Facilities where the information is captured in an electronic system. ",booklet4,715
536,538,"With advancement of the eIDSR enabler in Malawi, i.e. increased coverage of mobile networks, availability of eIDSR gadgets in most of our communities, health facilities are now equipped with difference sources of electricity (including solar power), the Ministry of Health has managed to scale up the One Health Surveillance Platform across the country. The eIDSR - OHSP system aims at facilitating the work of every staff member in a health system by improving disease surveillance using electronic tools and hence strengthening surveillance and response capacities. In a long term this will reduce morbidity and mortality from epidemic prone diseases as well as other public health events. ",booklet4,692
537,539,eIDSR is thus likely to improve the following; ,booklet4,47
538,540,·       Timeliness and completeness of reporting ,booklet4,49
539,541,"·       Early detection, investigation, and response to outbreak or public health events ",booklet4,89

557,559,·     Standardization of data ,booklet4,30
558,560,₋      Standardization of tools in eIDSR system enables data gathering to be consistent and complete to more easily facilitate data exchange and comparison across health facilities ,booklet4,181
559,561,·     Better data transmission and management including storage ,booklet4,64
560,562,"₋      A major challenge of paper based is a need to compile reports from various sources and provide these to higher level offices at regular intervals and to different administrative levels.  Moreover, data storage and transport can be difficult, and there is a risk of data damage and loss. ",booklet4,294
561,563,"₋      With eIDSR there is faster data transmission, and moreover, data are also organized into a format that is more accessible for use and interpretation. ",booklet4,157
562,564,·     Interoperability and sharing of data ,booklet4,43
563,565,"₋      eIDSR provides an opportunity for exchange and use of information across entities, especially if the standards and workflow have been well developed for the eIDSR system to allow interoperability with other information systems. ",booklet4,235
564,566,"·     Automated transmission, analyses and improved quality data ",booklet4,65
565,567,₋      Paper based reporting approach runs the risk of omitting valuable information when reporting to higher administrative levels. ,booklet4,133
566,568,₋      eIDSR reduces the number of data entry errors and facilitate automated data analysis saving considerable effort for health staff. ,booklet4,137

572,574,9.6 Key guiding principles in establishing eIDSR and progress in Malawi ,booklet4,72
573,575,"Based on the WHO recommendation, the following are key guiding principles in the establishment of eIDSR; ",booklet4,105
574,576,"·   Use of existing infrastructure: When possible, eIDSR should be built on existing framework and systems, such as paper-based IDSR, HMIS, DHIS2, etc. This enables easy adaptability by the implementers, and promotes smooth transitions. If there is already an existing infrastructure, eIDSR introduction may possibly not require major customization which might be costly.  In Malawi, the existing paper-based IDSR, HMIS/DHIS2 instance, community mobile applications are all leveraged and converge into the OHSP/DHIS2 as the main digital infrastructure during the COVID-19 pandemic and for the future. The existing infrastructure is enabling the further development and implementation of the eIDSR system in country. ",booklet4,716
575,577,"·   Standardization: Standardization of data and electronic tools will promote uniformity in data collection and aggregation. Standardization promotes comparison between the various levels of the health systems, and between countries. The eIDSR system components in Malawi are all aligned with the national standardized paper forms, i.e. Health Declaration Form at the POE, IDSR CBS reporting form, contact tracing form, etc.  ",booklet4,427
576,578,"·   Integration: IDSR is built on the in premise of integration. eIDSR should therefore be implemented in the spirit of integration. This could entail integration of the various data sources and information system from other health programs (e.g. malaria, EPI, cancer registry, non-communicable diseases etc.) into a common platform or data warehouse. The Malawi’s eIDSR OHSP system is the main data warehouse to store all IDSR related surveillance data and aiming to be fully integrated with different surveillance systems/data source. ",booklet4,537
577,579,"·     Interoperability- is the ability of different health information systems to work together within and across organizational boundaries to exchange data and use the information that has been exchanged. It is important that the standards and workflow that the eIDSR developers developed, should easily be interoperable with other information systems. The Ministry of Health through relevant digital health development, adopted the open Health Information Exchange (OpenHIE) framework for interoperability and this has resulted in development of the interoperability layer and its enabling components or registries. Through the interoperability layer different systems are now able to exchange surveillance data into the One Health Surveillance Platform as the main data warehouse for IDSR related data. ",booklet4,806
578,580,"·   Multi-sectoral Collaboration: It is essential to collaborate with stakeholders, such as telecom companies. Such collaboration could be in form of wavers, corporate social responsibility, and partial tax holidays etc. Effective collaboration could accelerate the roll out and coverage of eIDSR. Collaboration with other sectors like animal and environment is also key as this will facilitate efficient utilization of scarce resources, effective and prompt leveraging of various sectors capabilities for better disease prevention and control. In Malawi, the eIDSR OHSP system was designed to incorporate with animal and environment health surveillance data. The eIDSR taskforce is continuing the multi-sectoral collaboration work with relevant governmental sectors.  ",booklet4,769
579,581,"·   Near real-time approach: Every effort should be made to ensure provision of near real-time transfer of information about events incorporated into the design and implementation of eIDSR. This should be a long-term goal and countries will have to start slowly with planning and developing in phases. In Malawi, the Government Wide Area Network (GWAN), telecommunication service providers (i.e. TNM and Airtel), internet service providers (ISP)) are leveraged to provide eIDSR needed connectivity service. The Malawi Communications Regulatory Authority (MACRA) is engaged by the MOH to facilitate the relevant communication service for eIDSR. The aim for the country is to enable the nearly real-time surveillance from all levels of health services delivery. ",booklet4,760
580,582,"·   One Health: The One Health approach offers an innovative approach where various disciplines work together to address health at the human-animal-environment interface. In view of the fact that the majority of emerging and re-emerging infections are often zoonosis and responsible for large outbreaks in recent times, maintaining a focus on diseases that affect both humans and animals is a worthwhile investment. MOH is exploring potential technology solutions (i.e. mobile application, EMR automate disease surveillance, syndromic surveillance, drone technology, etc.) to reach the One Health surveillance goal. ",booklet4,616
581,583,"·   Data security: Protection of health information is essential in every health information system. Security of data will ensure that information is only accessible by authorized personnel, who need to take action. It also promotes ethical handling of data. Caution should be taken to ensure there are processes for patient privacy. The eIDSR data security and protection protocols of Malawi is following the MOH digital health, HIS policy and relevant government laws to ensure highest standard of protection is implemented. ",booklet4,527
582,584,"·   User-friendly system: The system should ideally be simple enough to be used by staff at all levels. It should be easy to log on, input and receive information. The system should also be flexible to adapt to change of disease and events profiles over time. In Malawi, the eIDSR taskforce is developing the system with agile and user-centred design principle. User feedbacks are regular collected and the development team together with the partners swiftly respond to the user needs to provide most user friendly interface and work flow. ",booklet4,540
583,585,9.7 eIDSR development and implementation Process in Malawi ,booklet4,59
584,586,"Developing an eIDSR system should be planned carefully with the involvement of all relevant stakeholders. The system should fit the capabilities and needs of the country, and a plan for securing resources should be developed prior to initiating eIDSR. ",booklet4,252
585,587,"The process of developing and implementing eIDSR in Malawi are shown below. The Ministry of Health is motivated to ensure the embarkation on eIDSR, by weighing the costs and benefits and also assessing the feasibility of eIDSR options in Malawi. ",booklet4,246

588,590,·         The success of eIDSR requires an effective engagement of all relevant stakeholders. ,booklet4,94
589,591,"·         In the context of Malawi, PHIM (the department responsible for IDSR) engaged the Digital Health Unit and key development partners to develop the eIDSR since 2015. An eIDSR taskforce was formed and is responsible for coordinating eIDSR development and implementation works. When PHIM initiated the eIDSR system development, the surveillance group engaged with the department that handles health information system. These two departments brought together all relevant stakeholders in the country to develop a technical working group required for coordinating eIDSR implementation. eIDSR implementation in Malawi is leveraging the ICT capacity provided by other line ministries, especially ministries of ICT. ",booklet4,716
590,592,ii. Assess country IDSR functionality ,booklet4,38
591,593,"·         The government had committed to utilize digital solutions for public service. The JEE and recent joint study with MOH partner emphasized the transformation of IDSR from paper to electronic system. In Malawi the IDSR functionality was assessed at all levels in 2015, this also included the assessment of political commitment to use ICT as a pivot of development and social transformation. The PHIM (IDSR unit) is designated to follow up on disease surveillance activities and implementation including the eIDSR development. The appointment of a disease surveillance focal point at district level across the nation was the key point in the success of eIDSR implementation. ",booklet4,681
592,594,iii. Determine country capabilities and needs ,booklet4,46
593,595,·         A crucial step in the development of an electronic system is to assess the capabilities and infrastructure needs of the country.

The IDSR support supervision checklist shall be used during supervisory visit, while considering the integrated needs from other teams in terms of joint supervision. Supportive supervision checklist has to be updated to incorporate eIDSR and uploaded as part of the eIDSR platform. The overall evaluation of the eIDSR system and its interoperability with the HMIS and eHealth system should be done periodically, using a blend of internal and external experts. ",booklet4,587
