Q378_question_answer,"Based on the provided information, here are some possible study designs to test hypotheses about the causes of an outbreak:  1. Case-control studies: These studies compare individuals who developed symptoms during the outbreak (cases) with individuals who did not develop symptoms (controls), in order to identify potential risk factors or causative agents associated with the outbreak. 2. Cohort studies: These studies follow a group of individuals (either cases or controls) over time, starting from before the outbreak occurred, in order to identify potential risk factors or causative agents associated with the outbreak."
Q381_question_answer,"From the given information, we can identify three types of epidemic curves: a sharp peak, a plateau, and a slow rise. Each of these shapes has different interpretations based on the timing of exposure to the infectious agent and the incubation period.
