Q287_question_answer,"An outbreak investigation is conducted to identify the cause of an outbreak, determine its scope and severity, and implement measures to control or prevent further spread. It also aims to provide information for public health decision-making and improve future preparedness.   In a hypothetical scenario, you are a Health Data Scientist working on a project related to Malawian public health. You have been given the task of investigating an outbreak that has occurred in a small village. The data available includes the number of people affected by the disease (D), the time it took for the disease to spread from person to person (T), and the average duration of illness per patient (I).  The following conditions are known: 1. If D > 100,000, then T is less than 2 weeks. 2. If I < 5 days, then T is more than 3 months. 3. If T = 1 month, then either D < 50,000 or I > 10 days. 4. If T = 2 months, then both D and I are within the normal range (50,000-100,000 people affected by the disease and 5-10 days of illness). 5. The total number of cases is less than 200,000. 6. The average duration of illness per patient is more than 7 days.  Question: Based on these conditions, can you determine if an outbreak investigation should be conducted?   First, we need to use the property of transitivity and deductive logic to analyze the given conditions. From condition 1, if D > 100,000 then T < 2 weeks. This means that if there are more than 100,000 cases, the disease has spread quickly.  Next, from condition 3, if T = 1 month, then either D < 50,000 or I > 10 days. This implies that if the disease has been spreading for a month, it could be due to either fewer people being affected or longer duration of illness per patient.  From condition 4, if T = 2 months, then both D and I are within the normal range (50,000-100,000 people affected by the disease and 5-10 days of illness). This means that if the disease has been spreading for two months, it is likely to be under control.  Now, we use inductive logic to infer from condition 6 that since the average duration of illness per patient is more than 7 days, this indicates a longer period of time during which the disease could have spread.  Finally, using proof by exhaustion, we consider all possible combinations of D and I within the given conditions. We find that only one combination satisfies all the conditions: D = 80,000 people affected by the disease, T = 2 months, and I > 10 days. This indicates a moderate outbreak with longer duration of illness per patient.  Answer: Yes, an outbreak investigation should be conducted as there are more than 100,000 cases (D > 100,000), but it is not severe enough to warrant immediate action due to the relatively short time taken for the disease to spread (T < 2 weeks). The average duration of illness per patient is also longer than 7 days. "

Q619_question_answer,"Yes, the abbreviation IHR (2005) is mentioned in the TG. It stands for International Health Regulations (2005).   Consider a hypothetical scenario where you are an IoT engineer working on a project to monitor and control the spread of infectious diseases using IoT devices. You have been given three different sets of data from three different countries: Country A, Country B, and Country C. Each country has its own set of rules and regulations regarding public health.  The IHR (2005) is an international regulation that all these countries must adhere to. However, the implementation of this regulation varies in each country due to their unique circumstances.  Here are some facts: 1. Country A strictly follows the IHR (2005). 2. Country B partially implements the IHR (2005), but there are certain exceptions. 3. Country C does not fully implement the IHR (2005) and has its own set of rules.  You have three IoT devices, each designed to monitor a specific aspect of public health: Disease Spread, Vaccination Rates, and Hygiene Practices.  The device in Country A is monitoring Disease Spread, the one in Country B is monitoring Vaccination Rates, and the one in Country C is monitoring Hygiene Practices.  Question: Which IoT device should you use to monitor the implementation of IHR (2005) in each country?   First, we need to understand that the IoT devices are designed to monitor specific aspects of public health. This means they can only provide information about their respective areas of focus and not about the overall implementation of IHR (2005).  Next, we know from the facts given that Country A strictly follows the IHR (2005), so it's safe to assume that the device monitoring Disease Spread in Country A is also following the regulations. This means the device is designed to monitor the spread of diseases and not the implementation of IHR (2005).  Similarly, since Country B partially implements the IHR (2005) with certain exceptions, we can infer that the device monitoring Vaccination Rates in Country B might be capturing data related to vaccination rates but not necessarily the overall compliance with IHR (2005).  Finally, for Country C which does not fully implement the IHR (2005), it's safe to assume that the device monitoring Hygiene Practices is also not designed to monitor the implementation of IHR (2005) but rather the hygiene practices in the country.  Answer: You should use the IoT devices to monitor Disease Spread in Country A, Vaccination Rates in Country B, and Hygiene Practices in Country C. The devices are not designed to monitor the overall implementation of IHR (2005). "

Mothers should also be taught about home treatment with oral rehydration. Finally, medium to long-term protective actions such as food chain restrictions may need to be considered if necessary. "
Q919_question_answer,"Based on the context provided, the most vulnerable populations in terms of malnutrition are children under 5 years old and pregnant or lactating women. These groups are particularly susceptible to the effects of malnutrition due to their developing bodies and increased nutritional needs. Additionally, those living in crisis-affected areas may also be at higher risk for malnutrition due to limited access to food and healthcare resources. "
Q927_question_answer,"The standard case definition for malnutrition in children under five includes being underweight, having a low birth weight, and having bilateral pitting oedema. Additionally, pregnant women who give birth to low birth weight babies are also considered malnourished. If more than 20% of children are underweight, the program will focus on breastfeeding support, nutrition education, supplementation for both child and mother, prevention and treatment of diarrhoea, severe malnutrition, and socio-economic support. "
Q928_question_answer,"A maternal death refers to the death of a woman during pregnancy or childbirth, regardless of the cause. It can be caused by various factors such as complications during labor, infections, or pre-existing health conditions. Animal deaths are not considered in this context. "
Q930_question_answer,"According to the World Health Organization, approximately 287,000 women die each year from complications related to pregnancy and childbirth. This includes both maternal deaths and perinatal deaths, which refer to stillbirths and neonatal deaths. "
Q932_question_answer,"The lifetime risk of maternal death in sub-Saharan Africa is 1 in 22. This means that a woman living in this region has a one in every 22 chance of dying from complications during pregnancy and childbirth. This is significantly higher than the global average, where the lifetime risk is 1 in 8,000. The main causes of maternal deaths in sub-Saharan Africa are severe bleeding, infections, hypertensive disorders, and obstructed labor. These can be prevented or treated with proper care and access to health services. "
Q936_question_answer,"The standard case definition for maternal death includes any woman who dies during pregnancy or within 42 days of termination of pregnancy, regardless of the duration and site of the pregnancy. This definition is used by the World Health Organization (WHO) to monitor and track maternal mortality rates globally. To calculate a case fatality rate, we need to know the number of deaths and the total number of cases in a given population or region. "

In this case, it is unclear what caused the outbreak as there is no information provided about the specific circumstances surrounding the outbreak. However, it is important to note that measles is highly contagious and can spread rapidly in areas where vaccination rates are low or where proper hygiene practices are not followed. "
Q963_question_answer,"The diagnostic test for measles is the presence of IgM antibodies to measles virus in serum. Specimens can be collected from whole blood, gingival fluid, or throat swab. It's important to collect specimens between the 3rd day of the rash and 28th day after onset of rash. In countries with an elimination target, it's recommended to collect serum for antibody testing at first opportunity or first visit to the health facility. For children, 1-5 ml of venous blood should be collected into a test tube, capillary tube, or microtainer. The blood cells should be separated from the serum and allowed to clot retract before centrifugation. "
Q964_question_answer,"Specimens should be collected between 3rd day of rash and 28th day after onset of rash. Blood samples on 5 suspected measles cases when the number of cases exceeds the measles outbreak threshold are recommended in countries with an elimination target. For children, 1-5 ml of venous blood is collected depending on size of child. The specimen should arrive at the laboratory within 3 days of being collected and results usually available after 7 days. If as few as 2 out of 5 suspected measles cases are laboratory confirmed, the outbreak is confirmed. To prevent bacterial overgrowth, ensure that the serum is poured into a clean glass test tube. Transport the serum in an EPI hand vaccine carrier to 4 C to 8 C to prevent bacterial overgrowth (up to 7 days). "
Q965_question_answer,"The reference for responding to measles outbreaks in measles mortality reduction settings is the World Health Organization's (WHO) guidelines for epidemic preparedness and response to measles outbreaks, WHOCDSCSRISR99.1 Outbreak response: A guide for improving early detection and preparedness for outbreak response.

Q968_question_answer,"MERS is a viral respiratory disease caused by a novel coronavirus called MERS CoV, which was first identified in Saudi Arabia in 2012. Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that can cause diseases ranging from the common cold to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and death. Typical symptoms include fever, cough, and shortness of breath, with pneumonia being common but not always present. Some laboratory-confirmed cases have been asymptomatic, meaning they do not show any clinical symptoms, yet they are positive for MERS following a laboratory test. Most reported patients with MERS have died. "
Q969_question_answer,"The typical symptoms of MERS include fever, cough, shortness of breath, and breathing difficulties. These symptoms can appear 2-14 days after exposure to the virus. It is important to note that these symptoms are similar to those of other respiratory illnesses, so it's crucial to seek medical attention if you experience any of them. "
Q972_question_answer,"The surveillance goal for MERS is to identify cases of the disease early on in order to prevent its spread. This involves monitoring individuals who have been exposed to the virus and testing them regularly to detect any signs of infection. By doing so, public health officials can take appropriate measures to contain the outbreak and protect the population. "
Q974_question_answer,"Specimens for laboratory confirmation of MERS should ideally be collected at least 14 days after exposure by a screening assay (ELISA or IFA) and a neutralization assay, in the absence of molecular confirmation from respiratory specimens. Inconclusive testing: Patients with an inconclusive initial testing should undergo additional virologic and serologic testing to determine if the patient can be classified as a confirmed MERS case. It is strongly advised that multiple lower respiratory tract specimens such as sputum, endotracheal aspirate, or bronchoalveolar lavage fluid be collected and tested when possible. If patients do not have signs or symptoms of lower respiratory tract disease and lower tract specimens are not available or clinically indicated, both nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swab specimens should be collected. If initial testing of a nasopharyngeal swab is negative in a patient who is strongly suspected to have MERS-CoV infection, patients should be retested using a lower respiratory specimen tract or a repeat of laboratory work. Laboratory guidance for MERS-CoV http:www.who.intentitycsrdiseasecoronavirusinfectionstechnical-guidance-laboratoryenindex.html Recommendations for specimen collection Lower respiratory specimens have a higher diagnostic value than upper respiratory tract specimens for detecting MERS-CoV infection. Upper respiratory tract samples have yielded negative results in some symptomatic close contacts of confirmed cases, who later developed pneumonia and tested positive on lower respiratory specimens. It is WHO has strongly advised that lower respiratory specimens such as sputum, endotracheal aspirate, or bronchoalveolar lavage be collected for MERS-CoV testing where possible. If patients do not have signs or symptoms of lower respiratory tract disease and the collection of lower tract specimens is not possible or clinically indicated, upper respiratory tract specimens such as a nasopharyngeal aspirate or combined nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs should be collected. If initial testing is negative in a patient who is strongly suspected to have MERS-CoV infection, the patient should be resampled and specimens collected from multiple respiratory tract sites. Paired acute and convalescent sera for antibody detection should also be collected. Virus has also been demonstrated in body fluids such as blood, urine, and stool, but usually at lower titres than in respiratory tract specimens. Such specimens may be collected when good quality respiratory tract specimens are unavailable, or to monitor the presence of virus in different body compartments. Table 1. Specimens to be collected from symptomatic patients and asymptomatic contacts Patient Test Type of sample Timing Storage and transportation Remarks Symptomatic Nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) Lower respiratory tract sputum aspirate lavage Upper respiratory tract naso pharyngeal and oro pharyngeal swabs naso pharyngeal washnaso pharyngeal aspirate Collect on presentation.

The virus can be transmitted through sexual intercourse, needle injections, transfusions, trans-placental or trans-vaginal routes, breast milk or other direct contact with infected human body fluids. Once someone is infected with HIV, it can progress to AIDS if left untreated. Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) results in late-stage HIV infection and immuno-suppression, which makes the body more susceptible to opportunistic infections that can be fatal. The source of infection or cause of an outbreak can vary depending on the mode of transmission, but it is important to identify and address the root causes to prevent further spread of the disease. "
Q997_question_answer,The incubation period for HIV is approximately 1 to 3 months from the time of infection to the time that antibodies can be detected in a laboratory process. The time from HIV infection to the onset of AIDS is generally 7 to 9 years. 
Q998_question_answer,"The populations at high risk of acquiring HIV include men who have sex with men, people who inject drugs, and women in relationships with men who have multiple sexual partners. These groups are more likely to engage in behaviors that increase their risk of contracting the virus. As for the influenza A (H7N9) virus, the general population is not at high risk as it primarily affects birds and can be transmitted from them to humans. However, people who work with poultry or live in areas where avian flu is prevalent may be at higher risk. The population at risk for epidemic-prone diseases and other public health emergencies varies depending on the specific disease and its mode of transmission. It's important to monitor these populations closely and take appropriate measures to prevent the spread of disease. "

These targets aim to improve maternal and child health outcomes in Africa, where a significant number of neonatal deaths occur each year due to birth asphyxia, prematurity, and neonatal infections. "
Q1010_question_answer,"Yes, perinatal deaths refer to the deaths of an infant during pregnancy or within the first 28 days after birth. Stillbirth is a type of perinatal death that occurs when a baby dies in the womb before it has had a chance to breathe and survive outside of the womb. "
Q1015_question_answer,"Perinatal deaths are analyzed and interpreted by examining the case fatality rate. This helps in understanding the overall mortality rate for perinatal deaths in a specific country or district. The data is collected from various sources such as reporting forms, which include information about the location of the death (village or town), place of death (community, health facility, district hospital, referral hospital or private hospital), and date of occurrence. Unique identifiers are assigned to both the mother and baby for record-keeping purposes. The pregnancy progress and care history is also recorded, including the number of antenatal visits and whether the mother had malaria during pregnancy. "
Q1017_question_answer,The recommended committee for reviewing perinatal deaths is the same as that for maternal deaths and can be renamed maternal and perinatal deaths surveillance and response (MPDSR) committee. It should be linked to the maternal condition where applicable. 
Q1022_question_answer,"The standard case definition for suspected, probable, and confirmed cases of pneumonic plague is as follows: - A suspected case of pneumonic plague is anyone with a cough that lasts less than 5 days and one of the following symptoms: striated sputum from blood or dyspnea or chest pain and fever (or history of fever) or at least 3 of the following: headache or chills or generalized or severe asthenia. - A suspicious death of plague is anyone who died suddenly without apparent cause but with an epidemiological link to pneumonic plague established and without biological sampling. - A probable case of plague is any suspected case of plague alive or deceased with a positive F1 rapid diagnostic test (RDT) or positive PCR alone. - A confirmed case of pneumonic plague is anyone who has a suspected case of plague in which Yersinia pestis has been isolated in culture, or suspect plague case with positive F1 RDT and positive PCR. The classification might vary according to the epidemiology of the individual diseases. Immunization status, if appropriate to this disease, should also be considered. "
Q1025_question_answer,"The measures for analyzing and interpreting data on pneumonic plague include case-based reporting of cases and deaths for routine surveillance, counting weekly cases and deaths for outbreaks, analysing age distribution to assess risk factors, and laboratory confirmation through culture or PCR testing. It is important to collect specimens from all suspected plague cases before administering antibiotics and monitor for severe adverse effects. "
Q1026_question_answer,"The diagnostic test for confirming pneumonic plague is a combination of culture and PCR (polymerase chain reaction) testing. A sample of blood or sputum can be used to isolate Yersinia pestis, which causes the disease. Seroconversion to Y. pestis F1 antigen in serum is also an indicator of infection. It's important to collect specimens from all suspected cases before administering antibiotics and monitor for severe adverse effects. "
Q1027_question_answer,"To prepare clinical specimens for pneumonic plague, they should be collected in a sterile container and transported to the laboratory immediately. The specimen should be stored at 4°C until it is tested. If home treatment is recommended, the patient should be instructed on how to collect and transport the specimen safely. Disinfectant solutions can also be prepared at home using household items such as bleach or vinegar. "
