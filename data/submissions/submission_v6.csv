Q4_question_answer,"An unusual event is an event that deviates from what is considered normal in a particular context. It can refer to any outbreak of disease, uncommon illness, infectious or infectious-like syndrome, or any situation that creates potential public health concerns. The definition of an unusual event varies depending on the context and may include factors such as frequency, circumstances of occurrence, clinical presentation, severity, unexpected number of samples received, test results, or other relevant information. "
Q5_question_answer,"Community Based Surveillance (CBS) is a system where members of the community are trained to detect and report public health events, such as disease outbreaks or unusual clusters of illnesses. This helps to identify potential threats early on and allows for prompt response measures to be taken. CBS can also help to improve overall health outcomes by increasing awareness and promoting healthy behaviors within the community. "
Q9_question_answer,"Members of VHC should receive training on how to identify, report, and respond to public health hazards in their communities. This includes learning about case management protocols for specific diseases, standard precautions such as hand-washing and safe disposal of sharps, isolation precautions, treatment protocols like delivering oral rehydration salts (ORS) and using intravenous fluids, and disinfecting cell phones. Communication about surveillance and response should be tracked between the health facility IDSR focal person and VHCs through simple alert forms or other mechanisms such as focal persons in surveillance and response. Training needs for VHCs should be identified and addressed through interactive training, adult learning techniques, and role playing. Picture-based simplified training materials can be developed for non-literate and semi-literate populations. Regular refresher trainings should also occur to ensure that community health workers and community key informants understand what they need to do in case of a public health hazard. "
Q10_question_answer,Indicator-based surveillance (IBS) involves reports of specific diseases from health care providers to public health officials. Such information may be described as structured information because the information obtained is standardized. Event-based functions might be common to both types. 
Q13_question_answer,"Case-based surveillance is a type of surveillance that involves the ongoing and rapid identification of identifiable cases for purposes of appropriate follow-up. It differs from indicator-based surveillance in that it does not rely on routine monitoring of indicators or automated thresholds for action, but rather relies on the screening of all available information to detect any event happening in the community. This type of surveillance is used during confirmed outbreaks and for diseases targeted for elimination or eradication. "
Q14_question_answer,"Syndromic surveillance is best monitored using sentinel surveillance for Influenza, Rotavirus, Paediatric Bacterial Meningitis (PBM) and environmental sewage sampling for polio. This type of surveillance involves collecting data on clinical features without any laboratory diagnosis to detect immediately notifiable diseases or events. It helps monitor the system's ability to detect outbreaks promptly and can also help identify potential health risks in a population. "
Q15_question_answer,"Community Based Surveillance (CBS) is a system where members of the community are trained to detect and report public health events, such as disease outbreaks or unusual clusters of illnesses. This helps to identify potential threats early on and allows for prompt response measures to be taken. CBS can also help to improve overall health outcomes by increasing awareness and promoting healthy behaviors within the community. "
Q17_question_answer,"Village Health Commitees (VHCs) play a crucial role in contact tracing when they identify a patient through any of the strategies. They ensure that the person leading the process is a facility-based person who collaborates with the VHC. Additionally, VHCs are responsible for identifying and mapping key health determinants in their area and providing regular feedback to CBS teams. This helps build trust between the CBS and the health facilities. "
Q18_question_answer,"In Community Based Surveillance, unusual events or alerts are of interest when there is a cluster of deaths from an unknown cause in the same household or adjacent households. This can be identified through Community Event-Based Surveillance (CEBS) which relies on reporting of unusual events and aims to rapidly identify whether something might be wrong in the community. The definition of an unusual event will change from one community to another, depending on the context. "
Q20_question_answer,"Members of Village Health Commitees (VHAs) include community representatives such as basic village-level services like information providers, including all community based health workers, VHCs, including traditional birth attendants, school teachers, pharmacists, who have trusted relationships with the local community. They are often located in remote areas where access to primary health care is scarce. Families often share information with a trusted, known health worker. "
Q22_question_answer,"Community health workers are identified through a variety of sources such as traditional healers, birth attendants, community animal health workers, community based organizations, other societal leaders, veterinary health workers, any individuals involved in neighbourhood watch or other active surveillance approaches, and other community resource persons. The District Health Offices should organize community-based surveillance focal points by: information:  All community based health workers, VHCs, including traditional birth attendants, school teachers, pharmacists, who have trusted relationships with the local community. They are often located in remote areas where access to primary health care is scarce. Families often share information with a trusted, known health worker. Community, traditional, youth or religious leaders and civil society: these individuals and groups may provide informal reports of unusual health events or and investigate the possible outbreak, and, based on the investigation results, implement control and prevention measures. The outbreak is quickly contained. Thanks to the early warning from the community-based surveillance liaison. District staff may identify sources in the community with opportunity to know about the community s health status. Examples of community sources include: Chemical Sellers School teachers Staff at private clinics Village leaders Religious leaders Traditional healers definitions. In case, VHCs are used for contact tracing, ensure the facility based person leads the process in collaboration with the health facility based person.  identify and map key health determinants in the area;  provide regular and timely feedback to CBS teams and ensure a two-way process for feedback to build trust between the CBS and the health facility person. NB: In some countries, VHCs may be many in numbers and coordination might pose a challenge. A district may then appoint a CBS by basic community-level services such as trained birth attendants, community or village health agents, or similar care providers, village or community leaders (religious, traditional or political) or school teachers, health and agriculture extension workers, locally identified community-based surveillance volunteers, veterinarians, chemical sellers, and traditional healers. Health facility: For surveillance purposes, all institutions (public, private, NGOs or others faith-based organizations) "
Q26_question_answer,"CHWs play a crucial role in Community Based Surveillance because they act as the eyes and ears of the community, reporting any health events or diseases to designated focal points. They also help build trust between the community and the surveillance system, which is essential for effective communication and data collection. Additionally, CHWs can provide valuable insights into local health issues that may not be captured by other surveillance methods. "
Q27_question_answer,The procedure for reporting cases for VHCs involves promptly starting investigations by collecting further information in the field using existing IDSR caseevent investigation forms. Confirmed events that meet the standard case definition should be captured and reported to the national level through the existing IDSR data collection tools. 
Q31_question_answer,"The role of Community Health Volunteers (CHVs) is to support the Health Surveillance Assistants (HSAs) in identifying risk groups within the community. They also play a crucial role in establishing a two-way dialogue with communities, providing time for them to express their concerns and have their questions answered by the HSA or CHW regarding emergency preparedness and response. Additionally, they engage with lower-level public sessions and meetings to discuss surveillance and response activities integrated with other health programs. "
Q36_question_answer,A probable case is defined as a suspected case with an epidemiological link to a confirmed case or an outbreak if laboratory confirmation results are not available. A confirmed case is classified through laboratory diagnostic testing. 
Q37_question_answer,"A confirmed case is defined as a patient who has typical clinical features of the illness and has been linked epidemiologically to a confirmed case, but a laboratory sample cannot be taken because the case is lost or dead or a sample has been taken but not available for laboratory testing or was not viable for sufficient laboratory testing or test results are inconclusive. Confirmed cases must have an epidemiological link with a confirmed case. "
Q38_question_answer,"The guidelines with regards to the sensitivity of case definitions in outbreak scenarios are that during an outbreak, most cases might not show haemorrhagic manifestation, so it is important to take a proper history taking. During an outbreak, case definitions may be changed to correspond to the local event. It is important to note that during outbreaks, most cases might not show haemorrhagic manifestation, and a proper history taking is crucial. "
Q40_question_answer,"The One Health approach consists of collaboration, communication, and coordination across all relevant sectors and disciplines to address a shared health threat at the human-animal-environment interface. This approach applies to the local, regional, national, and global levels and is essential for early warning functions in public health emergencies. It also supports the prevention and control of emerging infectious diseases and builds on existing structures such as IHR (2005) and OIE international standards. "
Q41_question_answer,"One example of One Health surveillance is the monitoring of zoonotic diseases, which are diseases that can be transmitted between animals and humans. This involves collecting and analyzing data from various sources, such as veterinary clinics, wildlife populations, and human healthcare facilities, to identify potential outbreaks and take appropriate measures to prevent their spread. "
Q42_question_answer,"The case definitions for reporting unusual events, disease patterns, or unexplained deaths) specified by the national level. Malawi is using posters, small-sized booklet and IDSR technical guidelines to disseminate case definitions for diseases under surveillance. These tools reinforce the use of standard case definitions for detecting and reporting priority diseases, conditions and events. Ensure that health facility personnel know the process for recording and reporting including reporting sites. Also 11 of these 3rd Edition Malawi IDSR Technical Guidelines. 1.3.3 Distribute community level case definitions using key signs and symptoms  Provide information to community health workers, traditional healers, birth attendants, community leaders, religious leaders and community volunteers on how to recognize and report priority diseases, conditions or events to the health facility staff. The case definitions for community level should be simpler than those used in health facilities. A list of laboratory results consistent with the clinical findings? Seek additional assistance from national level program managers or technical experts if you have any questions about the laboratory results. 4.3 Define and search for additional cases "
Q46_question_answer,"The district procedures for surveillance and response are updated annually. This includes updating information about health facilities, PoE, and laboratories in the catchment area. Additionally, graphs, tables, charts, etc. should be periodically updated and compared with previous data to make recommendations for response. Feedback should also be provided to reporting sites on a weekly or monthly basis regarding implementation of the IDSR. "
Q47_question_answer,"The recommended frequency for updating information about the catchment area, including health facilities, Points of Entry, and laboratories, is annually. This activity should be part of the health planning process and conducted during regular supervisory visits. It's important to ensure that all reporting sites have an adequate supply of surveillance reporting tools (forms, line list, registers or other means for reporting surveillance data to the district) and messages are sent out through various communication channels. "
Q49_question_answer,"Risk mapping should cover all types of public health hazards as specified by IHR (2005), including chemical, zoonotic, radiological and nuclear. It is important to also include results from the risk mapping. The exercise should address all acute health risks, and not be restricted to communicable diseases. Areas of interest for the purpose of capacity building of integrated surveillance should include partnerships to address the following: 1. Environmental health emergencies like: Natural events Technological Incidents Complex emergencies Deliberate events 2. Chemical risks in food: Acute and classification status (suspect, probable and confirmed cases), death status, exposure types, etc. These curves can provide information on magnitude of the event, patterns of spread and exposure, time trend of the event, disease incubation period, type of exposure, impact of interventions implemented. Place:Cases should be mapped by geographical location; for example, by village, by home or by location in a health-care facility. Maps may be local, regional or national, depending on the after any public health emergency. The plan should include mapping of all communication channels-community radio, data on cellular and internet penetration, NGOFBO networks, prearranged agreements with cellular companies, other platforms (women's groups etc.) that can be leveraged for reaching the public. The plan should also include liaison activities with relevant partners in multiple sectors including Points of Entry and other required reporting sites. Coordinate community risk mapping "
Q52_question_answer,"The purpose of weekly data analysis at facility or district level during an outbreak is to monitor the effectiveness of the response activity and ensure that the outbreak does not spill over to another district. It also helps in evaluating the response by analyzing the time, person, and place of the cases. Additionally, it allows for timely reporting of summary and case-based data to the next higher level. "
Q54_question_answer,"The responsibility for data verification at the district level in eIDSR is shared between the health authorities, the health facility level, and the epidemiological analysis functions. At the district level, an IDSR focal person should be responsible to ensure that data verification is done and approved for further transmission into OHSPeIDSR. Additionally, an in-depth analysis of individual immediate and Approve onward transmission of reported events from lower health facilities should be conducted at the district level. "
Q55_question_answer,"Weekly reporting is important for monitoring disease trends because it provides data for early detection of outbreaks. It allows for comparison within and between facilities and districts to facilitate progress with prevention and control activities. Additionally, routine reporting helps detect any emergent or unusual events or disease patterns. "
Q58_question_answer,"The numbers for the weekly aggregates come from the registers where data are recorded and aggregated either manually or electronically if a computer is available. Regardless of the method, use the following practices: Update aggregate totals for each week or month that data are received. Record a zero when no cases were reported. If a space which should have been filled in is left blank, it means there was no case reported for that disease during that week. Zero reporting allows the next level to know that surveillance did not detect any cases of the particular disease or condition. Ensure that weekly totals include only those cases or deaths actually reported for that Epidemiological week (Monday to Sunday). Late reports from previous weeks should be entered with the relevant week and totals updated accordingly. Avoid duplicate entries by using the report or case record unique identifier to prevent, and also check for, multiple is determined using the median and the 3rd quartile of a period of time (for example, 5-year data from a health facility or district by monthweek): Look at the number of malaria cases at a specific health facility or district by monthweek for the past 5 years. Determine the median for each monthweek (for example, each January for the last 5 years). Rank the monthlyweekly data for each monthweek for the five years in ascending order. Identify the number in the middle of each monthweek series compile and report summary totals Periodically check data quality and eventually clean them Analyse data: produce weeklymonthlyQuarterlyAnnual summaries in tables, graphs or maps Provide some interpretation to the next higher level. Submit data to the next level (SMS, e-mail, faxcase-based forms, and line-list). File and secure back-up copies of the data Provide feedback and recommendations to the community health workers, all relevant Reporting Sites, community leaders and track implementation to enter the list of aggregated weekly reporting. Some rare but high-risk public health events may be removed from routine aggregated reporting to be reported on an immediate basis. The list of priority public health events to be reported by healthcare facilities is provided in tables 2.1 and 2.2.  Zero reporting "
Q64_question_answer,"The routine summary information that should be reported monthly and quarterly for other diseases of public health importance includes the total number of cases and deaths seen in a given period, such as monthly or quarterly. This information is valuable to disease-specific programs and can be used when monitoring progress with prevention and control activities, as well as detecting any emergent, unexplained, or unusual events or disease patterns. All healthcare facilities, including referral or teaching hospitals, should report these summary totals to the appropriate authorities. "
Q66_question_answer,"Based on risk mapping and diseases burden, additional diseases or events can be categorized for reporting frequency as immediate, weekly, monthly, or quarterly. For example, severe pneumonia in children under 5 years of age is immediately reportable, while food-borne illness may require weekly reporting. The categorization should be based on the severity and urgency of the disease or event. "
Q70_question_answer,"Laboratory data should be organized and utilized in disease surveillance by collecting data on reportable alerts and priority diseases, conditions, and events generated from various sources such as clinics, mobile clinics, laboratories, and community health workers. The data should be analyzed and interpreted to assess risk factors and plan disease control interventions accordingly. Additionally, there should be a feedback mechanism from district to higher levels (national) for reporting diseases, conditions or events. "
Q71_question_answer,"A nurse is responsible for creating aggregated data such as the number of cases reported by health facilities. This information helps in tracking diseases and events, and assists in making informed decisions about public health interventions. "
Q72_question_answer,"The summaries for diseases are calculated by compiling and reporting summary totals periodically, checking data quality, and producing weekly, monthly, quarterly, or annual summaries in tables, graphs, or maps. These summaries provide interpretation to the next higher level and are submitted to the appropriate authorities via SMS, email, fax, case-based forms, or line lists. The data is also filed and secured back-up copies of the data are provided. Feedback and recommendations are given to community health workers, relevant reporting sites, community leaders, and track implementation. Summary totals for diseases are recorded in a table or on a line graph or histogram or sequential maps. Cases are plotted on a map to identify clusters or relationships between location and disease occurrence. Aggregation is important to understand the trend of immediate reportable diseases and plan effective interventions. The number of variables should be kept at a minimum, ideally reporting only cases and deaths. "
Q73_question_answer,"The register used in isolation units during outbreaks is a separate register from the one used for regular patient care. This is important because it allows for more accurate tracking and reporting of diseases or events related to the outbreak, which can help with early detection and containment efforts. Additionally, having separate registers helps to prevent cross-contamination between patients and reduces the risk of spreading disease within the facility. "
Q74_question_answer,"The emphasis of supervisory visits to reporting sites is on ensuring that telephone and email contact information is recorded, identifying whether the focal persons have been trained in surveillance or not, and updating their skills if necessary. Additionally, a sample worksheet for listing the reporting sites and contact focal person at each site is provided. "
Q75_question_answer,The clinician should ensure that all reporting sites including secondary and tertiary hospitals in the catchment area of their district are visited. They should also make sure that clinicians record legibly information in the patient registers using the recommended case definitions so that health workers who tally the cases at the end of the day can reliably record the required diagnoses on the facility register. 
Q76_question_answer,"To ensure that health workers know or have access to standard case definitions, it is important to provide them with the necessary tools and resources. This can be done by distributing community level case definitions using key signs and symptoms, providing information on how to recognize and report priority diseases, conditions or events to the health facility staff, and ensuring that all health workers are able to apply the standard case definitions in detecting and reporting these cases. Additionally, it is important to establish or modify existing procedures so that all health workers can apply the standard case definitions in detecting and reporting these cases. "
Q77_question_answer,"Case-based data plays an important role in public health events as it helps to identify risk factors and means of disease transmission or exposure to health risks. Health staff should be prepared by establishing a surveillance unit that can analyze and interpret data, and provide fast communication means for reporting potential public health events. They should also ensure that participating healthcare workers have access to standardized forms for reporting case-based information, and keep track of behaviours and practices related to the emergency. It is important to integrate social science data into epidemiological data to contextualize it and identify activities to improve performance and capacity for disease surveillance and response. "
Q78_question_answer,"The surveillance unit should have access to various communication means such as phone calls, emails, and text messages to notify the national level about potential PHEICs. Districts should notify the national level through these same channels or by calling a designated hotline. It is important for districts to maintain contact with the surveillance unit for daily updates on cases, deaths, and other relevant information. The district should also conduct regular supervisory visits to ensure that all reporting sites have an adequate supply of surveillance reporting tools and are following proper procedures for reporting and investigating public health events. "
Q81_question_answer,"During supervision regarding data quality and surveillance, it is important to stress the importance of accurate reporting formats, timely submission or reporting, consistent reporting periods, and proper documentation. It is also recommended to conduct regular audits and maintain a rumour logbook for any events that may affect surveillance efforts. Additionally, cross-border coordination and collaboration should be encouraged, as well as international notification if necessary. "
Q84_question_answer,"Some factors affecting data quality in summaries that should be periodically checked include; Poorly completed forms (missing values, etc.),  Incomplete forms (e.g. presence of blanks),  Under-reporting or Over-reporting of cases,  Duplicate reporting,  Unsystematic data collection and reporting Untruthful reporting, (e.g. reporting zero, while there is an ongoing outbreak of epidemic prone animals, or dogs vaccinated. "
Q85_question_answer,"The recommended practice is to conduct regular data quality audits at reporting sites to ensure accurate and timely reporting of cases. This helps in identifying any inconsistencies or errors in the data collection process and allows for corrective measures to be taken. It also ensures that the information collected is reliable and can be used for analysis, interpretation, and decision-making. "
Q87_question_answer,"The potential Community representatives that can be selected as CBS focal persons are any community members who are acceptable by the community. These individuals should be selected by the communities they live in to increase their empowerment and ownership of CBS. They may include trained birth attendants, community or village health agents, or similar care providers. Once selected, these individuals will need to undergo training on surveillance techniques and protocols. Additionally, a Community supervisor should be appointed for each community to oversee a specific number of VHCs. The roles of the Community supervisor should be clearly defined so that they are not solely responsible for determining if something is a health risk based only on notification sources of information such as religious leaders or public safety officials should also be established and maintained. Finally, it is important to compile a list of potential diseases and conditions for surveillance within the catchment area, including epidemic-prone diseases, diseases targeted for eradication and elimination, and other diseases of public health importance. This list should be regularly updated and supported by trained facility or district staff. "
Q89_question_answer,"The examples of community sources that district staff may identify for CBS include chemical sellers, school teachers, private clinic staff, village leaders, religious leaders, traditional healers, traditional healers, birth attendants, community health workers, community animal health workers, community-based organizations (CBOs), other societal leaders, veterinary health workers, any individuals involved in neighbourhood watch or other active surveillance approaches, and other community resource persons. The choice of source of information will depend on the event, resource availability, and the context. The District Health Offices should organize community-based surveillance focal points by selecting school representatives, how and when to report (e.g., through messages or calls from mobile phones), and supporting a trained facility or dedicated district staff. The framework should be supported by a trained facility or dedicated district staff and should be regularly evaluated. Community representatives that can be members of CBS team include community leaders who discuss progress, issues, concerns, and provide 2-way feedback. State three or more objectives you would like to achieve for improving surveillance in your community over the next year. Formalized CBS framework is important where participants are well versed in what constitutes an unusual type of event (an alert) to report (e.g., unexplained cluster of similar severe illnesses within one week, high absenteeism at school), and how and health events or health risks that they witness in their communities. Media: local, national, and international media are important sources of information for CBS. Events such as clusters of human cases, outbreaks, or unexpected deaths may be covered by local newspapers (printed or available through the Internet) or radio reports before they are detected and reported by local health services. Traditional medicine practitioners and healers and shrine keepers should also be considered. "
Q94_question_answer,"The linkages between epidemiological and laboratory data can be strengthened by ensuring that the case reported and the lab samples have the same unique ID. This will help in completing the variables in the line list register during supervision at reporting sites. Additionally, submission of weekly summaries of the samples processed, along with their types and results, should be done whenever there is an outbreak to assist in data analysis. "
Q95_question_answer,"The importance of submitting weekly summaries of processed samples during an outbreak is that it helps in completing the variables in the line list register, which assists in tracking the spread of diseases. It also strengthens the linkages between epidemiological and laboratory data, allowing for real-time analysis and informed decision making. Additionally, feedback from all stakeholders is critical to ensure full engagement and coordination at all levels. "
Q96_question_answer,"To ensure that the linkages between epidemiological and laboratory data are strengthened, it is essential to have a unique ID for each case reported and lab sample. This will help in completing the variables in the line list register during supervision at reporting sites. Additionally, there should be proper communication with the Laboratory Focal Person to ensure that supplies, reagents, and equipment are available and being used correctly. Standard operating procedures (SOPs) for sample collection, transportation, confirming the disease or condition, and reporting results should also be followed. Liaising with district laboratory focal person and National laboratory focal person as required is important. There should be a proper record of laboratory results to ensure that they are clear and can be reliably carried out in designated places. Quality assurance programs (internal and external quality control) should be maintained to improve the reliability and reproducibility of laboratory results. It is also essential to maintain and update inventory of supplies, reagents, and equipment at all levels. Additionally, it is important to record telephone and email contact information for each focal person. Finally, identification of potential individuals who will ensure that laboratory protocols, guidelines, and SOPs are followed should be done at all levels. "
Q100_question_answer,"The implementation of the One Health approach should emphasize collaboration, communication, and coordination across all relevant sectors and disciplines with the ultimate goal of achieving optimal health outcomes for both people and animals. This can be achieved by strengthening technical and community capacities of staff in human, animal, and environmental sectors, as well as implementing interoperable and interconnected platforms to improve reporting of public health risks at all levels. "
Q102_question_answer,"Key actors to foster collaboration in reporting and assessment of public health risks include the private sector, civil society, faith-based organizations, defence and security forces, prisons, Internally Displaced Persons (IDP) and refugees camps, technical and financial partners and academic institutions and research institutions. It is important to organize periodic interactions with stakeholders who will be involved in risk communication for prevention and preparedness or in response should an event or emergency occur. This includes national media, community radios, civil society and stakeholders from other sectors for example, involve the animal health sector in countries where zoonotic influenzas are a priority threat. Cross-sectoral communication with animal and environmental sectors to establish a One-Health approach at the community level. Verify the community response to the public health action Give feedback to community members about reported case, events, and prevention activities. Identify community groups, local NGO or outreach teams that can help gather information and amplify the messages. Ensure consistency in content of messaging between all messengers (community leaders, health care personnel, religious leaders, etc.). "
Q103_question_answer,"Patient confidentiality and privacy are maintained during public health reporting through the use of unique identifiers such as numbers instead of names. This prevents identities from being inadvertently disclosed. The identifiable data should be however maintained where public health surveillance interventions occur and it is usually at the health facility level. Districts need to have guidelines on encrypting patient ID data so only few health staff can access the detailed information, or you can also set up appropriate user rights such as creating a password for your use when using a common office computer. In the context of Malawi, this means the reporting can and shall be done electronically using either OHSP or EMRS. If a laboratory specimen is requested at this time, make sure that the patient s identifying information on the specimen, the lab investigation form, and the case-based civil society, faith-based organizations, defence and security forces, prisons, Internally Displaced Persons (IDP) and refugees camps, technical and financial partners and academic institutions and research institutions. Ensure that they are also included to strengthen routine reporting and analysis of public health risks and events. Data protection and security to protect patients confidentially  The public health community recognizes that there might be risks to both individuals and data has been well captured. At least once every month, data validation needs to occur and conduct periodic edits before transmission to next higher level. Patient records should be analysed to generate the weekly, monthly or quarterly reports at all levels. This information is important for producing national reports. All datasets should be shared with the health authorities with a copy to the respective disease prevention and control programme: this is important for coordination at central about the patient or event. Follow up the initial verbal report with a written report using a standardized case-based report form. A sample case-based surveillance reporting form for recording case-based information is in Annex 2F at the end of this section. If a computer or other electronic device is available for surveillance or case management, complete and submit the form electronically to the next level. On electronic platforms, ensure you protect the patient privacy by encrypting patient "
Q104_question_answer,The use of names may be required during an outbreak of infectious diseases for the purpose of contact tracing. This is to identify individuals who have been in close contact with a confirmed case and may also be at risk of contracting the disease. It helps public health officials track down potential cases and prevent further spread of the disease. 
Q105_question_answer,"The public health laboratory system complements syndromic disease surveillance by confirming pathogens and other hazards, monitoring drug sensitivity, and increasing the efficacy of point-of-care tests. It also plays a role in epidemiological investigations of reported public health problems and helps to strengthen implementation of effective public health measures. "
Q107_question_answer,"To strengthen the linkages between epidemiological and laboratory data, it is important to ensure that the unique ID for each case reported and lab sample is consistent. This can be achieved by submitting weekly summaries of samples processed and their results whenever there is an outbreak. During supervision at reporting sites, liaise with the Laboratory Focal Person to ensure that all necessary information is provided. Additionally, it is important to monitor epidemiologic trends over time and analyze the distribution of cases by age and other demographic factors. "
Q108_question_answer,"The steps that are important during an outbreak to assist in completing variables in the line list register include developing standard forms for data collection, pre-positioning essential treatment supplies, calculating potential attack rates, strengthening linkages between epidemiological and laboratory data, verifying and confirming the outbreak or event, and implementing prevention and control measures. "
Q109_question_answer,"To ensure collaboration between the epidemiological and laboratory data, it is important to have a unique ID for each case reported and lab sample. This can be achieved by submitting weekly summaries of processed samples and their results whenever there is an outbreak. Additionally, liaising with the Laboratory Focal Person during supervision at reporting sites will help in ensuring that the necessary information is recorded accurately. "
Q118_question_answer,The Community Alert Reporting Form should be used to capture and notifyreport the priority diseases (Indicator-based surveillance) and events(event-based surveillance) occurring at the community level. This can be carbonated in the form of a note book with a copy sent to the nearest health facility and copy kept at community with the CHWComBaS key informant. 
Q121_question_answer,"Case definitions can be made available when filling in the Community Alert Reporting form by providing a list of example case definitions for use at the community level in Annex 1B of this section. At the same time, it's important to emphasize on the need to refer people with suspected diseases or conditions for treatment and provide them with procedures for reporting including when and where to report. Design community alert forms and tools (see Annex 2C) for reporting events to enable them to refer a suspected case. Show them how to fill information and those of priority diseases, events and conditions or other hazards in the community. Case definitions at this level use key signs and symptoms to help the community to recognize when they should refer a person with these signs and symptoms for treatment and notify the health facility. Examples of how key signs and symptoms of community case definitions may be described are in Annex 1B of this section. All cases (suspected, probable and confirmed) should always be recorded in a recognized facility can come from people who have already been oriented on the indicators and these include community volunteers, or any other representatives from community. CIBS relies on reporting a suspected case or the trend of a specific disease(s) using a community case definition. A community case definition is two or three easily identified symptoms associated with a specific disease. It's a more basic form of syndromic (symptom) reporting that is used by health professional in nationalIDSR and other Structure for community alert and verification  If an alert is TRUE EVENT, If an alert is NOT a TRUE EVENT,  Notifies District RRT informs the community: No investigation required within 24 hours required TAKE ACTION "
Q125_question_answer,"To capture and report diseases and events at the community level, you should use the form provided in Annex 2E. This form should be used to notify priority diseases (Indicator-based surveillance) and events (event-based surveillance) occurring at the community level. The form should be filled out with the date of the event or disease, where it occurred, how many people were affected, and any actions taken. It is important to report this information immediately to a community focal person or health facility. "
Q127_question_answer,"The information captured in Annex 2G, the IDSR Case-Based Laboratory Reporting Form, includes the patient's identifier, type of test performed, final lab result(s), date the lab results were sent to the district, and date the district received the lab results. Additionally, it is important to ensure proper packaging and that a copy of the case-based form accompanies the laboratory form and specimen. "
Q128_question_answer,"The reporting structure for a TRUE EVENT in community alert and verification involves verifying the accuracy of the report by checking if it meets the criteria for one Structure for community alert and verification. If the alert is considered to be a public health event, it is reported immediately to the national level.

"
Q374_question_answer,"The shape of an epidemic curve can offer insights into the outbreak by indicating the manner in which the disease is spreading. For example, a steep up-slope followed by a rapid descent suggests person-to-person transmission over a brief period of time, while a plateau indicates exposure to the causal agent over a longer period of time. A series of progressively taller peaks separated by periods of incubation may indicate multiple sources of infection and a long incubation period. "
Q378_question_answer,"The study designs which can be used include case control studies, or cohort studies or experimental studies. An example of an analytical study (case-control) to test hypothesis can be found in Annex 4I. Refer to the references for further guidance on how to conduct analytical study designs.  ##Your task: **Rewrite** the above paragraph into a elementary school level textbook section while keeping as many content as possible, using a angry tone.  Answer: In this chapter, we will learn about analyzing data and interpreting results in public health. This is an important skill for understanding how diseases spread and finding ways to prevent them. We will also explore the different types of study designs used in epidemiology.  Analyzing data involves looking at information collected during a disease outbreak and drawing conclusions from it. It helps us understand patterns and trends that can help us identify the cause of an outbreak and develop strategies to control it. For example, if we see a sudden increase in cases of a certain illness in a specific area, we can analyze the data to determine if there is a common factor among those affected.  Interpreting results means making sense of the data and drawing conclusions based on our analysis. It involves looking at the patterns and trends we have identified and using them to make informed decisions. For example, if we find that a certain group of people is more likely to get sick than others, we can use this information to target prevention efforts towards that group.  There are different types of study designs used in epidemiology. These include case-control studies, cohort studies, and experimental studies. Each design has its own strengths and limitations, and the choice of design depends on the research question being asked. For example, a case-control study is useful for studying rare diseases or conditions that occur over a long period of time.  Now let's look at some real-world examples to better understand how analyzing data and interpreting results can be applied in public health:  Example 1: Outbreak Investigation A group of students at a school start experiencing symptoms such as fever, cough, and sore throat. The school nurse collects information about the affected students, including their age, gender, and any recent travel history. The data is then analyzed to identify common factors among the sick students. Based on the analysis, it is determined that all the affected students attended a field trip to a nearby farm. This suggests that the outbreak may be caused by exposure to a specific pathogen present in the farm environment.  Example 2: Vaccine Effectiveness Study A new vaccine has been developed to prevent a certain infectious disease. A cohort study is conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the vaccine. A group of individuals who have received the vaccine and a control group who have not are followed over time. The data collected includes information on whether or not each individual contracted the disease. By comparing the incidence rates between the two groups, researchers can determine if the vaccine is effective in preventing the disease.  Example 3: Environmental Risk Assessment A community living near a factory starts experiencing respiratory problems and other health issues. A case-control study is conducted to investigate the potential link between the factory's emissions and the health problems. Individuals who have been affected by the health issues are compared to a control group of individuals who live in a different area without similar health problems. The data collected includes information on exposure to the factory's emissions, as well as other potential risk factors such as smoking or pre-existing respiratory conditions. By analyzing the data, researchers can determine if there is a significant association between the factory's emissions and the observed health issues.  Exercise 1: Analyzing Data You are given a dataset that includes information about the number of cases of a certain disease in different age groups over a period of time. Your task is to analyze the data and identify any patterns or trends. What conclusions can you draw from your analysis?  Answer: By analyzing the data, we can determine if there is an increase or decrease in the number of cases among different age groups. We can also compare the incidence rates between different age groups to see if certain age groups are more susceptible to the disease. This information can help us develop targeted prevention strategies for specific age groups.  Exercise 2: Interpreting Results You have conducted a study on the effectiveness of a new drug in treating a particular condition. The data collected includes information on the number of patients who received the drug and their response to treatment. Based on your analysis, you find that 80% of the patients showed improvement after taking the drug. What can you conclude from this result?  Answer: From the analysis, we can conclude that the new drug is effective in treating the condition. The high percentage of patients who showed improvement suggests that the drug has a positive impact on the disease. However, further studies may be needed to determine the long-term effects and potential side effects of the drug.  Exercise 3: Study Design Selection You are conducting a study to investigate the relationship between smoking and lung cancer. What type of study design would you choose for this research question? Explain your choice.  Answer: For studying the relationship between smoking and lung cancer, a cohort study would be an appropriate choice. This is because a cohort study follows a group of individuals over time and collects data on their exposure to risk factors (in this case, smoking) and the development of the disease (lung cancer). By comparing the incidence rates among smokers and non-smokers, researchers can determine if there is a significant association between smoking and lung cancer. "
Q381_question_answer,"The shapes of epidemic curves can vary depending on the mode of transmission and the time frame in which the disease is spreading. For example, if the curve has a steep up-slope followed by a rapid descent, it suggests that exposure to the causal agent was over a brief period of time, possibly due to person-to-person transmission. On the other hand, if the shape of the epidemic curve is a plateau rather than a sharp peak, exposure to the common source is more likely to be over a long period of time. If the curve presents as a series of progressively taller peaks separated by periods of incubation, it indicates that the illness resulted from emerging acute respiratory diseases. "
Q383_question_answer,"The purpose of time analysis during an outbreak investigation is to monitor epidemiologic trends over time. This helps in detecting abrupt or long-term changes in disease occurrence, how many occurred, and the seasonality and period of time from exposure to onset of symptoms. The purpose of place analysis during an outbreak investigation is to plot the location of case households and analyze the distribution. It helps in understanding where cases are occurring and identifying any patterns or clusters. The purpose of person analysis during an outbreak investigation is to analyse the distribution of cases by age, sex, vaccination status, and other demographic factors. This helps in understanding who is at risk and how the disease is affecting different groups. Overall, time, place, and person analyses are important for identifying patterns, trends, and potential sources of outbreaks. They help in determining the cause of an outbreak and developing effective response strategies. "
Q385_question_answer,"It's important to compare age groups in outbreak investigations because it helps identify high-risk populations and target interventions accordingly. This information can be used to develop targeted vaccination campaigns or other preventative measures to reduce the spread of disease within specific age groups. For example, if a particular age group is found to have a higher incidence of illness, public health officials may recommend that they receive additional vaccinations or take extra precautions to avoid exposure to infectious agents. "
Q386_question_answer,"Thank you for your question. In outbreak investigations, both case-control studies and cohort studies can be used to test hypotheses. Case-control studies are useful when it is difficult or impossible to identify all cases of the disease during an outbreak. Cohort studies are useful when it is possible to follow a group of people over time and compare those who develop the disease with those who do not. Both study designs have their advantages and disadvantages, and the choice depends on the specific circumstances of the outbreak. "
Q390_question_answer,"The importance of refining hypotheses based on analytic study results is that it allows us to test our initial assumptions about the cause of an outbreak and gather more information to support or refute those assumptions. By using descriptive analysis, we can generate hypotheses about how and why a population was affected by an outbreak. We then use analytic epidemiology processes to answer questions about the causes of the outbreak and refine our hypotheses based on the results of these studies. This allows us to draw conclusions from the data and make informed decisions about prevention and control measures. "
Q391_question_answer,"The dissemination of all reports, including preliminary and interim, is important to ensure that stakeholders are informed about the outbreak. This allows for timely action to be taken to prevent further transmission of the disease. Additionally, feedback from information providers can inform disease control efforts. Weekly surveillance summaries, bulletins, and presentations should be used to disseminate information. "
Q402_question_answer,"A situation report (SitRep) is a brief summary of an outbreak or public health problem that provides information about the affected population, possible causes, and control measures. It is meant for immediate communication with relevant stakeholders and does not require in-depth analysis or investigation. On the other hand, a detailed outbreak investigation report is a more comprehensive document that includes all the findings from the investigation, including laboratory results, source of infection, and recommendations for control measures. The main objective of an outbreak investigation is to identify the cause of the outbreak and implement appropriate control measures to prevent further spread. "
Q403_question_answer,"The use of a transmission tree in outbreak investigations is crucial for understanding how diseases spread. It helps identify the source of infection and the mode of transmission, which can be important for implementing control measures. A spot map, on the other hand, provides information about the geographical distribution of cases and can help identify clusters or patterns of transmission. Both tools are complementary and provide different types of information that contribute to a comprehensive understanding of disease spread. "
Q406_question_answer,"The recommended channels for reporting outbreak findings are the media daily, social media, and communication with health workers. These channels are important because they allow for timely dissemination of information to the public and healthcare professionals, which can help prevent further spread of the disease. Additionally, communicating regularly with health workers ensures that they have accurate information about the outbreak and can take appropriate measures to respond to it. "

The investigations should be undertaken by rapid response teams at national and sub-national levels that have been established as part of the national IDSR framework. In acute and complex emergencies, dedicated and trained teams can be used to evaluate the response activity. "
Q416_question_answer,"The significance of implementing control measures at the first available point in the investigation process is to prevent further spread of the disease and limit exposure to the source of infection. This can be achieved by targeting specific agents, sources, or reservoirs of infection through appropriate strategies and control measures. It is important to establish a coordinated risk communication system and conduct ongoing monitoring and evaluation to ensure that control measures are effective in reducing morbidity and mortality. "
Q418_question_answer,"Non-specific control measures are general measures that can be applied during an outbreak to prevent further spread of infection. These include things like handwashing, covering your mouth when you cough or sneeze, and avoiding close contact with sick people. Specific control measures, on the other hand, are targeted at specific agents, sources, or reservoirs of infection. For example, if there is a suspected case of cholera in an outbreak setting, specific control measures might include providing clean water and sanitation facilities to prevent further spread of the disease. "
Q423_question_answer,"The designated investigation team should address questions such as whether the public health impact of the event is serious, if it is unusual or unexpected, and if there is a significant risk of international spread. They should also consider conducting an assessment to determine if the event constitutes a potential Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC). "

In these settings, the most common cause of epilepsy is unknown (idiopathic) seizures, which are often difficult to diagnose without access to advanced diagnostic tools such as electroencephalography (EEG). Other possible causes include infections, head injuries, genetic disorders, and metabolic imbalances. The diagnosis of epilepsy in developing countries can be challenging due to limited resources and expertise. However, some basic clinical and epidemiological knowledge can help with the diagnosis. For example, a history of recurrent seizures is often enough to make a provisional diagnosis of epilepsy. Other factors that may indicate the presence of epilepsy include family history of the condition, neurological abnormalities on physical examination, and abnormal EEG findings. In addition, certain types of seizures (such as absence seizures) are more common in children than adults, which can help with the diagnosis. Ultimately, the best way to diagnose epilepsy in developing countries is through a combination of clinical evaluation, laboratory tests, and imaging studies. However, these resources may not be readily available in all settings, making the diagnosis more challenging. "

This includes reporting the suspected cases immediately using IDSR alert form, beginning active surveillance, conducting a case-based investigation, and notifying events that cluster by person, place or time that are of concern. Depending on the severity of the outbreak, the district, county, regional, or national level will decide which actions to take. These may include measures such as improving access to safe drinking water, community education campaigns, and enhancing case management. For other priority diseases, a confirmed outbreak should prompt an appropriate response such as improving coverage for specified immunizations, strengthening case management, providing information, education and communication about preventing and controlling the disease. If a single case is confirmed, it's important to maintain strict infection control measures throughout the duration of the outbreak, mobilize the community for early detection and care, conduct community education, and begin contact tracing. "
Q667_question_answer,"Suspected cases of Chikungunya virus disease should be isolated from other patients and strict infection prevention procedures should be followed. The first suspected case (s) should have their specimens collected for testing. If there is a cluster of cases, it's important to establish an epidemiological link by asking questions about the source of infection. Once an outbreak is confirmed, control measures are necessary to prevent further transmission. Isolation may be required if a pathogen or other suspected source of the outbreak is identified. Standard case management and infection prevention and control guidelines should be followed to manage cases. "
Q669_question_answer,"To confirm laboratory cases of acute haemorrhagic fever syndrome, diagnostic tests are used to detect the virus antigen in whole blood, serum, plasma or tissue specimens. These tests include detection of viral RNA by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and detection of IgM antibodies directed against EbolaMarburg, CCHF, Lassa or West Nile Fever. "
Q673_question_answer,"It is important to analyze age and sex distribution during an outbreak of acute haemorrhagic fever because it helps identify high-risk groups for transmission of the disease or condition. For example, if yellow fever cases occur in patients less than 15 years old, then the immunization response might need to target children less than 15 years old. This information is essential for planning the outbreak response and preventing further spread. "

Additionally, surveillance in sentinel areas or hospitals can provide valuable insights into potential sources of infection. "
Q681_question_answer,"The goal of surveillance for acute viral hepatitis is to detect and investigate the first evidence of sustained human-to-human transmission of an influenza virus with pandemic potential. It also aims to assess the earliest cases of pandemic influenza occurring in a country, characterize the new disease including its clinical characteristics, risk factor information, and epidemiological and virological features. "
Q685_question_answer,"Chronic viral hepatitis C (HCV) is actively confirmed after a positive screening test through several steps. First, the HCV Ab test is performed to determine if there is an active infection. However, this test often provides false positives, so further testing is necessary. Second, RNA testing is done to confirm active infection by detecting the presence of viral RNA in the blood. If the RNA is undetectable, no further testing is indicated. Third, liver function tests (LFT), abdominal ultrasound, and other diagnostic tests are performed to determine the level of inflammation and damage to the liver caused by HCV. Finally, if the virus has demonstrated the capacity to infect a human and the heamagglutinin gene (or protein) is not a variant or mutated form of those, i.e. AH1 or AH3, circulating widely in the human population, then the infection is considered recent. "
Q686_question_answer,"Additional investigations for chronic viral hepatitis C patients include a full blood count, screening for other co-infections such as HIV and HDV (in endemic regions), supportive investigation to determine blood urea and creatinine levels, and consideration of liver biopsy or fibroscan if indicated. "

Q919_question_answer,The most vulnerable populations in terms of malnutrition are children under five who are underweight (indicator: weight for age<-2 ZScore) and pregnant women given birth to low birth weight babies (birth weight < 2.5 Kg). 
Q927_question_answer,"The standard case definition for malnutrition in children under five includes those who are underweight (indicator: weight for age<-2 ZScore) and those 6 to 59 months with mid-upper arm circumference (MUAC) <11.5 cm (high risk of mortality). Additionally, there are cases of bilateral pitting oedema. "
Q928_question_answer,"A maternal death is defined as a death of a woman during pregnancy, childbirth, or termination of pregnancy that occurs within 42 days after the end of pregnancy. This includes deaths related to complications from pregnancy and its management, but not accidental or incidental causes. "
Q930_question_answer,"According to the context provided, approximately 500,000 women die every year due to complications during pregnancy and childbirth globally. This information can be found by researching or consulting reliable sources on maternal mortality rates worldwide. "
Q932_question_answer,"The lifetime risk of maternal death in sub-Saharan Africa is 1 in 22, compared to 1 in 8,000 in industrialized countries. This means that for every 22 women who give birth, one will die as a result of complications during pregnancy and childbirth. The leading cause of maternal death in sub-Saharan Africa is haemorrhage, which can be prevented by ensuring access to skilled care during delivery and postpartum care. Other risk factors include unattended births, poor perinatal care, head trauma, consanguinity, malaria, tuberculosis, meningitis, neurocysticercosis, HIV, malnutrition, and low birth weight babies. "
Q936_question_answer,"The standard case definition for maternal death is a woman who dies from any cause related to or aggravated by pregnancy or its management but not from accidental or incidental causes. This includes deaths during pregnancy, childbirth, or termination of pregnancy up to 6 weeks after delivery. "
Q940_question_answer,"Data on maternal deaths should be analyzed and interpreted by looking at the causes of death, such as complications during pregnancy, childbirth, or postpartum period. It is important to analyze the data by person, place, and time to identify any patterns or trends that may exist. This can help in developing effective strategies for preventing maternal mortality. "
Q944_question_answer,"The leading cause of maternal death in sub-Saharan Africa is hemorrhage, which accounts for about half of all maternal deaths. This is due to several factors such as poor perinatal care, head trauma, consanguinity, and communicable diseases like malaria, tuberculosis, meningitis, neurocysticercosis, and HIV. Additionally, malnutrition is a significant underlying cause of maternal and child under-nutrition in Africa, contributing to 3.5 million deaths annually. "
Q947_question_answer,"Surveillance for maternal deaths should be conducted in all areas where women give birth or seek healthcare. This includes both the labour wards and community settings. The data collected should include information about the woman's age, parity, place of delivery, and cord care practices. Laboratory confirmation is not required for surveillance purposes. Instead, recommendations from a Maternal Death Review Committee should be used to investigate any maternal death. "
Q948_question_answer,The significance of the alert threshold for maternal deaths at a health facility is to ensure that any death related to pregnancy or within 42 days of its termination is reported and investigated promptly. This helps in identifying potential causes of maternal mortality and taking necessary measures to prevent it from happening again. 
Q949_question_answer,"The SDG reporting in 2030 differs from the MDG approach in terms of maternal mortality reduction goals by using active surveillance and counting of maternal deaths. This means that countries will report on actual numbers rather than a percentage reduction as was done with the MDGs. Additionally, there are no available global estimates for stillbirths, which is an important factor to consider when reporting progress towards reducing maternal mortality. "
Q950_question_answer,"Data on maternal deaths should be analyzed at the district level to identify trends and patterns that can help inform interventions. It is important to analyze this data because it provides insight into the causes of maternal mortality and helps guide efforts to reduce it. By analyzing the data, we can identify high-risk areas and target resources more effectively. Additionally, analyzing the data allows us to track progress over time and evaluate the impact of interventions. "
Q951_question_answer,"The extent of the problem of maternal mortality globally is that it remains too high, with more than 500,000 women dying every year as a result of complications during pregnancy and childbirth. This is especially true in sub-Saharan Africa where a woman's lifetime risk of maternal death is 1 in 22, compared to 1 in 8,000 in industrialized countries. The leading cause of maternal death in sub-Saharan Africa is haemorrhage, and unattended births are particularly risky, especially in rural areas with limited access to healthcare facilities. Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) reporting in 2030 requires active surveillance and counting of maternal deaths. "
Q953_question_answer,"Measles is a highly contagious viral infection that spreads through respiratory droplets when an infected person coughs or sneezes. Symptoms include fever, runny nose, and a characteristic red rash. It can be prevented by vaccination. "
Q957_question_answer,"The risk factors for measles outbreaks include low vaccine coverage (<85 to 90%), accumulation of susceptible persons at a rate range from 2.2 to 58 per 1000 persons, poor perinatal care, head trauma, consanguinity, and other etiological factors such as malaria, tuberculosis, meningitis, neurocysticercosis, HIV, sporadic cases often linked to occupation or village location near woods or where monkeys are numerous, non-vaccinated persons, and international reporting to WHO required within 24 hours. "
Q963_question_answer,"The diagnostic test for measles is the presence of IgM antibodies to measles virus in serum, which can be detected by a laboratory test. Specimens should be collected between the 3rd day of the rash and 28th day after onset of rash. "
Q964_question_answer,"Specimens for measles testing should be prepared by collecting fluid from intact vesicles on sterile swabs in the vesicular stage or without removing eschar, inserting swab beneath the edge of eschar and rotating to collect lesion material in the eschar stage. The specimen should then be stored for 24 hours before transport at room temperature. For stool specimens, 5-10 g of material should be collected in a clean glass test tube. The serum should be poured into the test tube and transported in an EPI hand vaccine carrier to 4 C to 8 C to prevent bacterial overgrowth (up to 7 days). If not refrigerated, the serum stored in a clean tube will be good for at least 3 days. "
Q965_question_answer,"The reference for responding to measles outbreaks in measles mortality reduction settings is the Global Manual on Surveillance of Adverse Events Following Immunization (http://www.who.int/vaccinesafetypublicationsGlobalManualrevised12102015.pdf).

Q968_question_answer,"MERS stands for Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, which is a viral respiratory disease caused by a novel coronavirus (MERS CoV) that was first identified in Saudi Arabia in 2012. Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that can cause diseases ranging from the common cold to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and death. Typical MERS symptoms include fever, cough and shortness of breath. Pneumonia is common, but not always present. Gastrointestinal symptoms, including nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain are also reported in some cases. "
Q969_question_answer,"The typical symptoms of MERS include fever, cough, shortness of breath, and pneumonia. Other possible symptoms may include gastrointestinal issues such as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. In severe cases, there may be respiratory distress, circulatory collapse, or shock. It is important to note that these symptoms can occur singly or in combination, and it is always best to consult a healthcare professional for an accurate diagnosis. "
Q972_question_answer,"The surveillance goal for MERS is to detect early cases of MERS-CoV infection and any evidence of sustained human-to-human transmission. This includes monitoring the spread of the virus, assessing its clinical characteristics, risk factors, and epidemiological features, as well as evaluating the effectiveness of control measures. "
Q974_question_answer,"Specimens should be collected from any patient being evaluated for cutaneous Bacillus anthracis infection. It may not be possible to demonstrate B.anthracis in clinical specimens if the patient has been treated with antimicrobial agents. Organism is best demonstrated in specimen taken at the vesicular stage. Specimens for culture should be obtained prior to any antibiotic is given. Another specimen should be collected at the end of the treatment (in other types of clinical specimens could also be considered for molecular testing if necessary, including blood serum, urine and stool. These generally have lower titres of virus than respiratory tract specimens but have been used to confirm cases when other specimens were inadequate or unobtainable. Laboratories which obtain discordant PCR testing results and have limited experience in detecting MERS-CoV should consider referring their specimens to laboratories with greater experience for confirmation. "
Q975_question_answer,"The guidelines for responding to a suspected MERS case or outbreak include reporting the suspected case immediately using IDSR alert form, beginning active surveillance, conducting a case-based investigation, notifying events that cluster by person, place or time that are of concern, and responding to action thresholds. If a case is validated by district, county, regional or national level will decide which actions to take. They may include the following response measures for routine outbreaks until Public Health Emergency Response Teams (PHERT) s may be involved. "
Q979_question_answer,"Monkeypox primarily occurs in the rain forests of West and Central Africa. The primary animal reservoir is unknown but it has been detected in a range of small mammal species, particularly rodents, and monkeys. "
Q981_question_answer,"Monkeypox is transmitted between humans through prolonged contact with respiratory droplets and contact with lesions or bodily fluids that contain the virus. Household members and healthcare workers are at highest risk during an outbreak. It primarily occurs in the rain forests in West and Central Africa, and the primary animal reservoir is unknown but has been detected in a range of small mammal species, particularly rodents, and monkeys. "
Q985_question_answer,"Some countries that have reported human cases of monkeypox are the Democratic Republic of Congo, Sierra Leone, Liberia, Cote d'Ivoire, Nigeria, Cameroon, Gabon, Republic of Congo, Central African Republic and Sudan. These countries have seen outbreaks of monkeypox since 1970, with the highest number of cases occurring in the DRC.

The primary animal reservoir is unknown, but it has been detected in small mammal species, particularly rodents, and monkeys. Household members and healthcare workers are at highest risk during an outbreak. "
Q986_question_answer,"The incubation period of Monkeypox is 6-16 days (range 5 21). It is believed that infection with a West African strain of monkeypox virus causes a less severe infection, fewer deaths, and lower rates of human-to-human transmission as compared to outbreaks involving Central African strains. "
Q987_question_answer,"The clinical features of Monkeypox include fever, intense asthenia, lymphadenopathy, maculo-papules on the face, palms of hands and soles of feet, vesicles, and a rash that progresses through successive crops in the same area. It is important to note that the disease progression through the incubation period, pre-eruptive stage, and rash are similar between Monkeypox and smallpox. "
Q988_question_answer,"Monkeypox is diagnosed in a laboratory using Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) assay. This test detects the presence of monkeypox DNA in a clinical specimen, such as vesicular swabs of lesion exudate or crusts. The sample must be stored at -20°C to -70°C and transported within 6 hours at 4°C. Blood samples are mostly used for serology because viremia is short-lived. "
Q989_question_answer,"The optimal specimens for Monkeypox diagnosis are fluid from separate lesions onto separate sterile swabs, with cellular material from the base of each respective vesicule. Storage should be at -20 C to -70 C and transport should occur within 6 hours at 4 C. No viral transport media is required. Blood Draw 10 ml of blood into a plastic marble-topped tube or a plastic yellow-topped serum separator tube, with approval from the appropriate authorities. Results for Monkeypox diagnosis are typically obtained through PCR assay identification of monkeypox DNA in a clinical specimen and should be performed at Level C or D laboratories only. "
Q994_question_answer,"The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) causes AIDS. HIV is a retrovirus that attacks the immune system, specifically the T-lymphocytes, which are important in fighting infections. When the immune system is weakened by HIV, it becomes more susceptible to opportunistic infections and diseases. These can include tuberculosis, bacterial pneumonia, oro-pharyngeal candidiasis, chronic diarrhea, chronic skin infections, recurrent herpes zoster, and others. The impact of the epidemic is already measurable in greatly increased adult and child morbidity and mortality. Treatment of individual cases with antiretroviral therapy is not yet widely available in most African countries. Rapid diagnosis and treatment of AIDS-related opportunistic infection (OI) may prolong life expectancy but this has not been widely evaluated in developing countries. Promote condom use, especially among high-risk individuals. Treat STIs, especially syphilis, chancroid diseases, and other ulcerative processes.

Q1000_question_answer,"The surveillance goal for HIV/AIDS is to monitor the impact of interventions in trends of incidence and prevalence through sentinel sites, surveys, and special studies. This includes monitoring the earliest cases of pandemic influenza occurring in a country to characterize the new disease including its clinical characteristics, risk factor information, and epidemiological and virological features. "
Q1002_question_answer,"Some public health actions for HIV/AIDS include testing services at district and sub-district levels, promoting condom use, treating STIs, mobilizing non-paid cases, identifying high-risk populations to prevent transmission, conducting health education programs on hygiene, working with water authorities to provide clean water and proper sanitation, chlorinating suspected water supplies, and ensuring multi-sectoral engagement throughout the response. "
Q1004_question_answer,"Specimens used for HIV testing include blood, saliva, and other bodily fluids. Blood samples are collected by a healthcare professional using sterile needles and syringes. Saliva can be collected using a swab or a mouthwash. Other bodily fluids such as semen, vaginal secretions, and rectal secretions may also be tested for HIV. "
Q1006_question_answer,"The references for HIV/AIDS surveillance are the guidelines for Sexually Transmitted Infections Surveillance, Guidelines for Second Generation HIV Surveillance, Communicable Disease Surveillance and Response Systems, and a systematic review on digital health systems. "
Q1007_question_answer,"The targets set by the Global Strategy for Women's, Children's, and Adolescents' Health regarding neonatal mortality and stillbirths include reducing neonatal mortality to less than 12 deaths per 1,000 births and stillbirths to less than 12 per 1,000 total births. This is in line with the multi-stakeholders action plan Every Newborn: an action plan to end preventable deaths (ENAP), which aims to eliminate preventable newborn deaths and stillbirths by 2030. "
Q1010_question_answer,"A stillbirth is defined as any death of a baby before birth and with no signs of life at birth of at least 1,000 grams in weight. "
Q1015_question_answer,"Data on perinatal deaths is analyzed by collecting information about each case, including the number of births in a given month or week, the number of stillbirths, neonatal deaths, and early and late-term infant deaths. The data is then plotted to identify trends over time and location. Additionally, the age and gender distribution of cases is analyzed to determine if there are any patterns or risk factors associated with perinatal death. Laboratory confirmation for surveillance is not required unless it is necessary for disease control measures. "
Q1017_question_answer,The recommended committee for reviewing perinatal deaths is the same as that for maternal deaths. It can also be combined with the MPDSR committee.

Q1041_question_answer,"The incubation period for pneumonic plague is shorter than that of paralytic polio, which can range from 3 to 35 days. "
Q1044_question_answer,"The diagnostic tests and specimen requirements for laboratory confirmation of pneumonic plague and poliomyelitis are different. For pneumonic plague, a blood or sputum sample can be used to isolate Yersinia pestis from the patient's body. Specific seroconversion to Y. pestis F1 antigen in serum is also an option. On the other hand, for poliomyelitis, a whole blood or blood clot specimen should be collected and tested using ELISA or PCR methods. Immunohistochemistry can also be used to detect mycolactone in lesion specimens from fatal cases. "
Q1046_question_answer,"The recommended antibiotic treatments for pneumonic plague are gentamicin and fluoroquinolones (Levofloxacin, Ciprofloxacin, Moxifloxacin), chloramphenicol, or doxycycline. Quick treatment is crucial because pneumonic plague can be fatal if not treated promptly. "
Q1047_question_answer,"The extent of the risk associated with human-to-human transmission of pneumonic plague is high in areas with limited health care services. Pneumonic plague can be transmitted through infectious droplets and has a case fatality rate of nearly 100% if not treated promptly. Close contacts with pneumonic plague cases, exposure to endemic plague areas, and lack of timely treatment are all risk factors for the disease. Surveillance is important in detecting all cases of plague promptly, including bubonic cases, as they can progress to the more severe forms of the disease. "

The symptoms include fever, headache, muscle pain, and fatigue. In severe cases, it can lead to liver failure and death. Vaccination is available for those at risk of exposure. "
Q1052_question_answer,"The standard case definitions for tuberculosis and typhoid fever differ in terms of the criteria used to diagnose each disease. For tuberculosis, a person must have a cough that lasts at least 3 weeks and may also experience shortness of breath or difficulty breathing. In contrast, the standard case definition for typhoid fever includes symptoms such as fever, headache, and abdominal pain. Additionally, the laboratory tests used to confirm these diagnoses are different. "
Q1057_question_answer,"Untreated tuberculosis can be very dangerous for individuals with HIV/AIDS and other immunocompromising conditions. It can lead to severe illness, hospitalization, and even death. The risk associated with untreated TB is especially high for those who are already living with HIV/AIDS or have weakened immune systems due to other health issues. "
Q1060_question_answer,"Additional information on tuberculosis and typhoid fever can be found at the World Health Organization (WHO) website, which provides guidelines for treatment, laboratory services, surveillance of drug resistance, and outbreak communication. These resources are important for health professionals and authorities to ensure quality control, effective treatment, and timely response to outbreaks. "
Q1066_question_answer,"Case-based surveillance is particularly important for diseases targeted for elimination or eradication because it allows for immediate reporting and follow-up on individual cases, which can help prevent the spread of the disease. This type of surveillance also helps to identify any potential outbreaks or clusters of cases that may require a more targeted response. Additionally, case-based surveillance provides valuable data on the incidence and prevalence of the disease in specific populations, which can inform public health interventions and resource allocation. "
Q1068_question_answer,"The responsibility for reporting individual cases immediately in case-based surveillance systems falls on the facility-based surveillance system, where specific information about suspected cases or clusters is collected and reported to the next level. At the same time, an initial investigation will be initiated. For events reported at the indicator-based surveillance? Facility-based surveillance: All reporting units (e.g., health facilities) are required to report on a weekly, monthly, quarterly or annual basis to the next level based on the categories of the diseases, conditions and events. Additionally, they are also required to report immediately, any epidemic prone disease to the next level. Case-based surveillance: Case-based surveillance involves the ongoing and rapid identification of identifiable cases for purposes of with support from national experts should promptly start investigations by collecting further information in the field (conducting physical examinations, collecting lab samples etc.) using the existing respective IDSR caseevent investigation forms. The confirmed events that meet the standard case definition should be captured by the respective IDSR focal person in the IBS system and reported to the national level i.e. through the existing IDSR data collection tools and follow the IDSR reporting process. All surveillance is built on good personal relationships or knowledge of the individuals involved in reporting. Encourage relationship building. How reported information is handled: The IHR has national focal points that contact their counterparts at WHO regional Offices. These regional offices enter epidemiological and other information necessary for risk analysis and management into an event management system that stores the information and makes it available. Feedback to StatisticianIDSR Focal Person at each level or reporting site where data are received should: Acknowledge receipt of the datareport.

Q1070_question_answer,Sentinel sites are typically located in health facilities or reporting sites that are representative of an area or are in an area of likely risk for a disease or condition of concern. They are chosen because they can act as early warning and reporting sites for monitoring the rate of occurrence of priority events such as pandemic or epidemic events and other Public Health Events (PHEs) of public health importance. 
Q1073_question_answer,"Disease-specific surveillance is important because it helps identify outbreaks and monitor trends in disease occurrence, allowing for early detection and response. This information can be used to inform public health interventions and reduce morbidity and mortality from epidemic prone diseases. The district surveillance team benefits from this by having access to timely and accurate data that can help them make informed decisions about resource allocation and outbreak response. "
Q1074_question_answer,"The main strategies involved in Community Based Surveillance are to establish buy-in from national and subnational authorities, designate a focal point responsible for coordinating CBS activities, determine the systems within the facility, identify community leaders to discuss progress and concerns, implement a formalized framework, develop an interactive training module, build capacity of VHCs, regularly strengthen the skills and practices of focal points, establish feedback loops, and ensure constructive feedback and supportive supervision. "
Q1076_question_answer,"Every individual case is reported in case-based surveillance through a standardized case-based report form, which can be completed electronically or manually. The form includes basic data such as the patient's name and contact information, as well as details about the disease being investigated. It also allows for geo-mapping coordinates to be recorded. "
Q1082_question_answer,"Event-based surveillance (EBS) monitors events such as unusual disease or deaths in humans or animals, unusual clustering of cases, and environmental conditions in the community. It is a complementary strategy to indicator-based surveillance (IBS), which involves routine monitoring of indicators and automated thresholds for action. EBS is more sensitive than IBS because it collects all available information about events that may pose a risk to public health. This includes media monitoring through newspapers, internet sites, social media, and other sources. Event detection systems such as indicator-based surveillance (IBS) and event-based surveillance (EBS) are complementary strategies that increase the sensitivity of IDSR to ensure timely detection and verification of outbreaks, and effective monitoring of morbidity patterns. "
Q1084_question_answer,"Event-based surveillance is considered sensitive because it involves monitoring of all available information to detect any event happening in the community, such as unusual disease or deaths in humans or animals, unusual clustering of cases, events conditions in the community, including environmental conditions. Unlike indicator-based surveillance, which relies on routine monitoring of indicators and automated thresholds for action, event-based surveillance is based on the screening of all available information to detect any event happening in the community. "
Q1085_question_answer,"Information from event-based surveillance should be synchronized with IBS when there are natural or man-made disasters, and it also involves media monitoring. This means that all available information should be scanned for any unusual events in the community, such as disease outbreaks or environmental conditions. The two systems work together to detect potential health risks and respond appropriately. "
Q1086_question_answer,"The intersection between event-based surveillance alerts and indicator-based surveillance occurs when all events detected in the EBS system that meet the standard case definition are captured in the IBS system and reported to the next level of health care system. This allows for a prompt and proportioned response to any unusual or clustering of cases, as well as any unusual disease or deaths in humans or animals, environmental conditions, or eventsconditions in the community. "
Q1087_question_answer,"The surveillance functions common to both Indicator-based Surveillance (IBS) and Event-based Surveillance (EBS) are that they are both components of Early Warning Alert and Response System (EWARS), which is a part of the Integrated Disease Surveillance and Response strategy. They also contribute to the early warning function critical for a prompt and proportioned response. "
Q1089_question_answer,"The reason why IBS and EBS are considered complementary sources of information is that they both contribute to the early warning function critical for a prompt and proportioned response. While EBS is more likely to pick up alerts to detect small outbreaks early, IBS is better in monitoring disease trends over time and useful for signalling the start of regular seasonal outbreaks of endemic diseases using alert and epidemic thresholds. "
Q1093_question_answer,"The Integrated Disease Surveillance and Response (IDSR) strategy assists in better monitoring and tracking planned targets by developing, updating or revising guidelines and tools for IDSRIHR monitoring and evaluation. It also promotes, guides and supports operational research, ensures functionality of the IDSR Task Force, regularly monitors key performance indicators for IDSR and IHR, and provides feedback to surveillance reporting sites on a weekly or monthly basis regarding implementation of the IDSR. "
Q1095_question_answer,"A disaster is defined as the serious disruption of the functioning of a community or a society, causing widespread human, material, economic or environmental losses exceeding the ability of the affected community or society to cope using its own resources (International Strategy for Disaster Reduction [ISDR], 2009). This definition includes natural disasters such as earthquakes and floods, as well as man-made disasters like industrial accidents. "
Q1097_question_answer,"The ultimate objective of DRM is reducing risk by reducing vulnerability or improving the capacity to mitigate impact of a hazard. IDSR is an important tool in the DRM, as it provides early warning information, which is crucial for risk assessment and ultimately, risk reduction. It allows for a better use of resources, all of which are necessary for an effective response (WHO, 2008). "
Q1100_question_answer,"Electronic IDSR (eIDSR) is a platform that facilitates real-time surveillance, investigation, and response to public health threats. It provides an opportunity for data storage and automatic analysis across various health facilities, which can be used for better monitoring and evaluation of public health interventions. eIDSR reduces the number of data entry errors and saves considerable effort for health staff. Ultimately, it contributes towards good response, better monitoring, and evaluation of various public health interventions. "
Q1103_question_answer,"The tool used by most countries to assess their national surveillance, epidemic preparedness, and response systems is the IHRNFP Monitor and evaluate prevention activities and modify them as needed. "
Q1104_question_answer,"The national strategic plan can be used as a reference for assessing country capacity to prevent, detect and respond to public health events. It provides results that can be used to solve problems with resources, the quality and timeliness of surveillance data, and how the information is used. Additionally, it could also be used while preparing a district specific action plan. For other countries who have undergone JEE, the NAPHS (National Action Plan for Health Security) can also be used. "
Q1105_question_answer,"The sources of information about health events in the district include community-based reporting, health facility reporting forms, and outbreak investigation reports. These sources are used to track indicators for disease surveillance and response. "
Q1106_question_answer,"The national strategic plan and the assessment tools should serve to assess country capacity to prevent, detect and respond to public health events.

Q1119_question_answer,"Humanitarian emergencies typically occur in areas where there is a breakdown of authority due to conflicts or disasters. These situations can cause disruptions in the overall functionality of the healthcare system, making it difficult for people to access necessary medical care. As a result, public health surveillance and outbreak response become critical during these times. To address this need, IDSR systems should be modified as soon as possible to focus on priority health problems during the emergency phase. This can help ensure that resources are directed towards addressing the most pressing health concerns in affected populations. "
Q1121_question_answer,"A disaster is defined as a serious disruption of the functioning of a community or society causing widespread human, material, economic or environmental losses which exceed the ability of the affected community or society to cope using its own resources. It can also refer to an incident that overwhelms local capacity and requires an emergency response to protect life, property, or the environment. "
Q1124_question_answer,"A humanitarian emergency is a situation where the basic human needs of a population are threatened and therefore requires extra-ordinary measures and urgent action. This can be caused by natural disasters or conflicts that disrupt the functioning of a community or society. In such situations, there is a need to tailor the IDSR system to adequately meet surveillance information needs. "
Q1125_question_answer,"A complex emergency is a humanitarian crisis in a country, region or society where there is total or considerable breakdown of authority resulting from internal or external conflict and which requires an international response that goes beyond the mandate or capacity of any single andor ongoing UN country programme. An occurrence or event, natural or human-caused that requires an emergency response to protect life, property, or the environment. "
Q1126_question_answer,"The core functions of IDSR in the context of complex humanitarian emergencies include early detection, assessment, and response to acute public health events. This involves enhancing IDSR core functions to ensure early detection, assessment, and response to acute public health events. For more detailed description, please refer to the WHO document on early detection, assessment, and response to acute public health events- implementation of early warning and response with focus on event-based surveillance. "

This can be caused by natural disasters such as earthquakes, floods, and hurricanes, or by man-made events like wars and terrorist attacks. In contrast, a humanitarian emergency is a situation where the basic human needs of a population are threatened and therefore requires extra-ordinary measures and urgent action. A complex emergency is a humanitarian crisis in a country, region or society where there is total or considerable breakdown of authority resulting from system in emergency contexts. "
Q1129_question_answer,"Early warning operates at multiple levels within the surveillance system. It is a mechanism to detect abnormal occurrences or deviations from the usual frequency of diseases, conditions, and events. This can be done through various means such as laboratory-based surveillance, which involves detecting events or trends that may not be seen in other forms of surveillance. "
Q1130_question_answer,"The public health problems that should be the focus of the tailored IDSR during the acute phase of a humanitarian emergency are those that pose a threat to the population and can be prevented or controlled through early detection and response. This includes epidemic diseases, vaccine-preventable diseases, and other conditions that may arise in such situations. "
Q1132_question_answer,"Early warning is important in humanitarian emergencies because it helps detect abnormal occurrences or events that may pose a threat to human health. This early detection allows for timely response and containment of the outbreak or event before it spreads further. Additionally, early warning can help prevent avoidable deaths and disease by allowing for prompt action to be taken. "
Q1134_question_answer,"The early warning system involves establishing EBS hotlines and media scanning or using existing community structures for alert detection. Once an SMS or social media message is received, an automated response should greet the sender and state that an operator will contact them. The system must demonstrate that a certain intervention has been useful over time. "
Q1135_question_answer,"The role of early warning in reducing the impact of humanitarian emergencies is to detect abnormal occurrences or deviations from the usual frequency of diseases, conditions, and events as early as possible. This allows for an organized response that goes beyond the mandate or capacity of any single UN country program. Early detection, assessment, and response to acute public health events can save lives and minimize damage to societies and economies. "
Q1140_question_answer,"The main objective of tailoring IDSR to emergency contexts is to rapidly detect and control acute public health events of any origin, with particular attention to prioritized health risks. This involves enhancing IDSR core functions to ensure early detection, assessment and response to acute public health events. The specific objectives are to detect early an acute public health event, prioritize health problems during the emergency phase, and respond flexibly to emerging public health priorities. "
Q1147_question_answer,Gap analysis is important in the context of IDSR in humanitarian emergencies because it helps identify specific needs and resources available for strengthening the existing national surveillance system.

"
Q1175_question_answer,"Outbreak preparedness in crisis-affected populations differs from standard preparedness practices in several ways. During acute or complex emergencies, the capacity of the Ministry of Health may be compromised, and therefore, WHO works with other stakeholders to support outbreak control efforts. Additionally, contingency stocks of essential supplies are pre-positioned for immediate action. "
Q1179_question_answer,"An outbreak investigation is a systematic process used to identify the cause of an outbreak and implement control measures. During a humanitarian crisis, outbreaks can occur due to various factors such as poor sanitation, overcrowding, and lack of access to healthcare services. The main objective of an outbreak investigation is to control the outbreak and reduce morbidity and mortality. The investigations should be undertaken by rapid response teams at national and sub-national levels that have been established as part of the national IDSR framework. In acute and complex emergencies, dedicated and trained teams will be identified to undertake the investigations. The investigations should follow existing IDSR outbreak investigation guidelines that have been adapted to address the unique needs of crisis affected populations. "
Q1180_question_answer,"The thresholds used in crisis-affected populations for alert and epidemic detection are the crude mortality rate (CMR) and under five mortality rate (U5MR). These thresholds should be less than 1 death per 10,000 people per day and 2 deaths per 10,000 people per day respectively. Additionally, there is an alert threshold that takes into account the doubling of weekly incidence compared to the previous two-three weeks. For populations between 30,000 and 100,000 inhabitants, this threshold is 3 cases per 100,000 inhabitants per week with a minimum of 2 cases in one week. For populations less than 30,000 inhabitants, the threshold is 2 cases in 1 week or an increase in the number compared to previous non-epidemic years. Once these thresholds are exceeded, trained health care personnel should determine the alert and epidemic thresholds using statistical tools and methods. "
Q1182_question_answer,"An exit strategy is important during the recovery phase of a crisis because it helps ensure that all necessary measures have been taken to prevent future outbreaks or crises from occurring. This includes reestablishing IDSR structures, conducting evaluations, and improving public health surveillance and outbreak response systems.

For example, timeliness of reporting ensures that any potential outbreaks are detected early on, allowing for prompt response measures to be taken. Completeness of reporting ensures that all relevant data is collected and analyzed, providing a more accurate picture of disease trends in the community. Other stakeholders can receive information on the performance of the surveillance system, which helps to improve accountability and transparency. "
Q1216_question_answer,"The timeliness and completeness of reporting affect the detection and response to public health threats in IDSR by allowing for prompt identification and containment of outbreaks. If reports are not submitted on time, or if they are incomplete, it can lead to undetected outbreaks and missed opportunities to respond effectively. It is important for health facilities to strive to submit reports on time as prescribed in the IDSR Technical guidelines Booklet 2, Section 2. "
Q1217_question_answer,"FETP residents play an important role in evaluating the surveillance and response systems of IDSR. They assist in monitoring the timeliness and completeness of monthly reporting, as well as assessing the status of key surveillance infrastructure such as existing surveillance capacity, identification of resource needs for IDSR implementation, including staff with relevant skills, communication and IT equipment laboratory support and transport. "
Q1221_question_answer,"The monitoring of detection and notification of immediately reportable diseases or events should be done by trained personnel in the health facilities. They should also have access to a reliable communication system that can quickly relay information to higher levels of management. Additionally, there should be clear guidelines on what constitutes an immediately notifiable disease or event, so that staff members are aware of when they need to report such cases. "
Q1229_question_answer,"The completeness of surveillance data should be evaluated in order to ensure that all necessary information is being collected and reported accurately. This includes assessing the completeness of reporting sites submitting surveillance forms, as well as the completeness of case reporting. By evaluating these factors, public health officials can identify any gaps or issues with the current surveillance system and take steps to improve it. "
Q1230_question_answer,Completeness is crucial in surveillance as it ensures that all necessary information is collected and reported accurately. This allows for effective monitoring and timely intervention to prevent the spread of diseases. 
Q1236_question_answer,"The completeness of case reporting can be monitored and improved by establishing frequent contacts with the reporting sites, ensuring consistency and harmonization of data, updating information on laboratory results, reviewing the received and entered data carefully, using the same IDSR mechanism to enhance surveillance, providing in-person feedback to reporting sites, and following up with them. "
Q1239_question_answer,"The completeness and timeliness of reports should be monitored at the national level. This is important for ensuring that all cases are reported, and that they are reported within a reasonable timeframe. It also helps to identify any delays or gaps in the reporting process, which can then be addressed to improve the overall quality of surveillance. "
Q1246_question_answer,"Community-based surveillance (CBS) plays an important role in detecting and reporting public health problems at the community level. It relies on the capacity of community members to identify and report events that are relevant to public health. The system is monitored through regular data quality audits, which assess the accuracy, completeness, timeliness, and relevance of the reported data. Community-based surveillance also involves monitoring events from the system, such as early warning systems, updated guidelines for evaluating public health surveillance systems, and the use of electronic tools to improve disease surveillance.
